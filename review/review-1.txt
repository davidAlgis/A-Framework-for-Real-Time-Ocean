A JCGT paper should provide a concrete technique with sufficient
information to allow the reader to:

* Understand how it differs from alternatives
* Know the advantages AND limitations that will likely be encountered
  in practice
* Immediately integrate it into a production workflow

While not every acceptable paper must have this form, a great example
of a JCGT paper would be a technique that addresses a common graphics
problem, has been used in production, can be well-summarized in a few
pages with a complete implementation in a popular language and full
performance or accuracy evaluation.

As an example, SIGGRAPH paper on a new stable physics algorithm would
have a philosophical introduction, extensive related work, a
derivation section, and attractive result images for some common
benchmark scenes. A JCGT physics paper might instead begin by
sketching available physics libraries, have a minimal related work
section on current research, give a derivation augmented with complete
source code (maybe as supplemental files), and replace the results
section with timing on various architectures, extensive discussion of
stability and limitations, and a table of results on real-world test
cases.

Yes. The paper combines methods developed for ocean simulation and solid-fluid coupling over the past few decades into a complete system with a good discussion of the choices made and their limitations. I believe this is a helpful source for anyone who would like to implement such an ocean simulation system in a video game.

The main contribution of this paper is the system, explaining which techniques are helpful in practice, and providing sufficient details to describe them without getting too much into their derivations. The paper also includes novel components but I would consider them minor.

The improvements on the existing literature are minor. Their practical implications are also not clearly presented, such as what happens if one were to use a simpler method for estimating the fluid velocity away from the surface? On the other hand, the paper describes how to combine methods developed for different components of an ocean simulation system into a single framework, which seems valuable.

The mathematical descriptions are sufficient, though there are some errors (see below). Algorithmic descriptions could be improved. I am not sure if the paper includes sufficient information for aiding an implementation-oriented reader. There are no source codes included and no pseudocodes in the paper.

The paper provides some limited evaluation using only 2 scenes with a single hardware configuration. Therefore, I would not consider that the system described in the paper is battle-tested. That said, it includes a sufficient evaluation to indicate that the system works and delivers good performance on a hardware with reasonable specs.

The novel components are not properly tested. The paper includes some numerical evaluation, but I would have also liked to see qualitative comparisons to see how they impact the results.

The title and the abstract are OK. I would emphasize the novel components a bit less, since their magnitude is limited and the paper lacks qualitative evaluation.

The paper is easy to read. It is a bit verbose and could be shortened, but I think it is acceptable.

The paper includes numerous errors/typos:

- The normalization factor Q is missing in Equation 13.

- Figure 3 caption mentions the dispersion parameter, but the figure is actually about another parameter \delta.

- I am confused about the parameters of the listed cascades in Section 2.3. First of all, the ranges listed seem wrong: 12/16 is clearly greater than 12/256. I presume this is a typo. Also, shouldn't L be larger for smaller k?

- Figure 9 caption says that F_a is "applied to the center of the submerged part." It should be the "unsubmerged part" instead.

- It is unclear what Figure 11 c shows.

- h* in Equations 48, 50, and 59 should be negative (following Equation 46). The same goes for unlabeled equations above Equation 53.

- In the Equation above Equation 56, "sinh(kY)" should be "sinh(ky)."

- The parameters y, t, and k in Equations 59, 60, 61, and 62 are written in an inconsistent order. They should all use the same order.

- This sentence in Appendix A is unclear and needs more explanation: "Note that while the third equation of system 1 is not used here, it can help to deduce the dispersion relation."

- In Equation 71 v_y should be v_z.

- In Equation 73, there appears to be an extra term: h(x,t)/dt


Other minor issues:

- The abstract ends with the term "fluid to solid algorithm." I would replace it with "fluid to solid coupling algorithm."

- The introduction begins with mentioning "scientific computing," but the paper is not about scientific computing at all. I would replace it with "computer graphics."

- I would recommend removing the subsection title 1.1 and converting Section 1.2 (related work)  to Section 2.

- On page 5, "standard gravity" should be "gravitational acceleration."

- In Section 3.2.3 the description of \rho_a is repeated.

- In Section 4.4.2, "M has is bow" should be "M has a bow"

- On page 27, "fluid to solid coupling FDM" should be "solid to fluid coupling FDM."

The bibliography is OK, though I am a bit confused as to why Yuksel's PhD thesis is referenced, instead of the related paper:

@article{Yuksel2007,
   author       = {Cem Yuksel and Donald H. House and John Keyser},

I enjoyed reading this paper. I would have liked it a lot more if it included more detailed descriptions of the algorithms and/or source code.
