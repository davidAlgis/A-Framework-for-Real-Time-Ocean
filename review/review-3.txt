A JCGT paper should provide a concrete technique with sufficient
information to allow the reader to:

* Understand how it differs from alternatives
* Know the advantages AND limitations that will likely be encountered
  in practice
* Immediately integrate it into a production workflow

While not every acceptable paper must have this form, a great example
of a JCGT paper would be a technique that addresses a common graphics
problem, has been used in production, can be well-summarized in a few
pages with a complete implementation in a popular language and full
performance or accuracy evaluation.

As an example, SIGGRAPH paper on a new stable physics algorithm would
have a philosophical introduction, extensive related work, a
derivation section, and attractive result images for some common
benchmark scenes. A JCGT physics paper might instead begin by
sketching available physics libraries, have a minimal related work
section on current research, give a derivation augmented with complete
source code (maybe as supplemental files), and replace the results
section with timing on various architectures, extensive discussion of
stability and limitations, and a table of results on real-world test
cases.

Yes, the first part of the paper that enables improved water->solid interaction definitely deserves attention.



> *  What is the concrete contribution ("technique") of this paper? 

The paper presents a novel and apparently quite efficient, accurate and convenient method 
of calculating velocities of water body at the surface and underneath, based on using inverse FFT over ocean spectrum
on the set of horizontal slices at the fixed water depth. 
Optimization technique, aimed at improving simulation precision at fixed cost by distributing slices 
logarithmically and using piecewise non-linear interpolation, is presented.
The paper shows the thought process and explanation to steps that led to derivation of the method.

The water->solid interaction simulation method used in this paper is not novel and is based on summing up forces acting on hull triangles submerged in water,
but coupled with simulation of water volume presented in the paper, it allows to achieve much higher accuracy for simulating movement of the solid objects in water.

The solid->water interaction simulation is rather primitive and does not deserve attention.


> *  How does this technique improve on the existing literature for the

The paper enables straightforward implementation of simulation of movement of solid bodies in water with high accuracy.


> *  Is this paper topical?

Yes, I want to try to improve my simulation of solid objects based on simulation of waver volume presented in the paper.


> *  Does the paper provide sufficient information for you to deploy
>    the technique?

Yes. Water->solid action part of the paper is very solid.

Although, the solid->water action simulation is primitive and lacks explanations and obvious improvements:
1. The movement of the hulls and how the corresponding translations/rotations of hulls affect the solid->water interaction is not clearly described.
It appears that only the translation part is taken in account.
2. Finite difference method used to simulate interactive waves is extremely primitive and is able to simulate vertical displacement of interactive waves only. 
Tessendorf's eWave based on FFT+iFFT per simulation step is a bit more expensive but produces full 3D displacements of the interactive waves.
3. Injecting displacements into water caused by movement of solid objects, called wave generation in the paper, based on functions representing side and front/back effect, looks absolutely artificial. 
Instead, a per-gridpoint signed difference in volumes produced by intersections of hull volume and still water volume at current vs previous simulation step 
could be used to generate water displacements based on incompressibility pf water.
4. Mask movement and orientation used in paper, so that front of the mask is above water surface and back is below water surface, looks artificial and extremely simplified.
A propulsion force acting on hull and causing it to move, in conjunction with proper water->solid interaction from the 1st part of the paper, with its forces and moments, 
will naturally cause hull to raise its bow based on physically correct simulation instead of oversimplified approximation used in the paper.


> *  How has the technique been proven or battle-tested?

Analysis of performance vs precision was done, analysis of the simulation stability for interactive waves was done.
Videos showing simulation in action were attached.

Title and abstract look ok.

Overall the paper allows to implement presented technique without much trouble for people that have experience with the topic of the paper, 
although better explanation of how the forces acting on solid object in water are summed up and used to evolve solid object dynamics would improve it a lot.
Is the sum of the forces applied to center of gravity of the object? Or there are rotational moments?
Are moments of inertia of the solid object taken in account? 
What about the moment of inertia of water body surrounding the object?
Without those explained, this part of the abstract looks like a bit of overstatement:

"this paper proposes to bring all these components together, detailing all their interactions, in a
comprehensive and fully described real-time framework that simulates the free ocean surface
and the coupling between solids and fluid."

I didn't find factual errors.
One note: deciseconds? Please, use seconds or milliseconds.

> *  Is the bibliography adequate (not too little or too much)?  
>

The paper lists a ton of references that are not touched in the paper in the sense that the paper does not derive anything from those.
For instance, 
1. SPH papers are not related.
2. Wave particles are not related
3. Water wave packets are not related

I'm not sure. 

> *  Additional comments are welcome here.

In chapter 2.6 the "interpolation degree" term is unclear and a bit misleading, 
and since the interpolation is based on water body displacements calculated at "slices" with fixed depth, 
I'd suggest term "interpolation slice" and "number of interpolation slices", for instance on Figure 7.
