Decision: Accept

The idea of publishing a paper that aids in the implementation of a system, more than focusing just on novelty, seems in the spirit of JCGT and it is to me welcome.

The reviewers also noted positively this fact, and through that lens mostly ask (review 1 and 2 especially) if some of the verbosity can be shortened in favor of perhaps adding more implementation details (pseudo-code, data structure layouts where relevant, etc.).

I mostly agree that these would be welcome improvements, considering the nature of the paper it is important to read if from the perspective of someone who is more implementation-minded.

That said - I don't think these improvements are strictly necessary for publication, if the errors and typos noted by the reviewers are addressed - to me they are good suggestions for the authors on how to improve the presentation of the paper, but ultimately, it's in the author's hands to decide what's the best angle - in ours it's only the evaluation of whether or not the paper is interesting enough for our venue (and I think it is) and of course, correct errors.

Lastly, I also would not emphasize the suggestion of adding more test scenarios and evaluations of the novel parts of the paper, as researchers we always want to see more comparatives - and it's obviously a good thing if these can be produced, but I find that's a suggestion that is almost universally valid but also rarely a critical thing to address.

Note from EiC: it is probably worth noting the work https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3675388 in a revision, which in fact was published after submission of this work.
