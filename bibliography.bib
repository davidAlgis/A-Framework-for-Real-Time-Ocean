  abstract = {Recently, correctly handling spatial information from multiple scales has proven to be essential in Machine Learning (ML) applications on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) problems. For these type of applications, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that use Multiple Downsampled Branches (MDBs) to efficiently encode spatial information from different spatial scales have proven to be some of the most successful architectures. However, not many guidelines exist to build these architectures, particularly when applied to more challenging 3D configurations. Thus, this work focuses on studying the impact of the choice of the number of down-sampled branches, accuracy and performance-wise in 3D incompressible fluid test cases, where a CNN is used to solve the Poisson equation. The influence of this parameter is assessed by performing multiple trainings of Unet architectures with varying MDBs on a cloud-computing environment. These trained networks are then tested on two 3D CFD problems: a plume and a Von Karman vortex street at various operating points, where the solution of the neural network is coupled to a nonlinear advection equation.},

  abstract = {Boundary handling is an important aspect of fluid simulation, and several boundary handling approaches exist in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), which have individual strengths and weaknesses. However, comparing different boundary handling approaches is challenging as there is no common basis for evaluations, that is, no universal set of experiments with quantitative evaluation across different methods, especially within computer animation where many evaluations rely mainly on visual perception. This article proposes a set of experiments to aid the evaluation of the main categories of fluid-boundary interactions that are important in computer animation, that is, no motion (resting) fluid, tangential and normal motion of a fluid with respect to the boundary, and a fluid impacting a corner. We propose ten experiments, comprising experimental setup and quantitative evaluation with optional visual inspections, that are arranged in four groups which focus on one of the main category of fluid-boundary interactions. We use these experiments to evaluate three particle-based boundary handling methods, that is, pressure mirroring, pressure boundaries, and moving least squares pressure extrapolation, in combination with two incompressible SPH fluid simulation methods, namely IISPH and DFSPH, to establish a quantifiable relation between different combinations of boundary handling with simulation approaches and the main categories of fluid-boundary interactions. Finally, we summarize all results in a rating table and show how our experiments can be used to determine the promising method for specific requirements regarding a given constellation of fluid-boundary interaction.},

  abstract = {Realistic handling of fluid-air and fluid-solid interfaces in SPH is a challenging problem. The main reason is that some important physical phenomena such as surface tension and adhesion emerge as a result of inter-molecular forces in a microscopic scale. This is different from scalar fields such as fluid pressure, which can be plausibly evaluated on a macroscopic scale using particles. Although there exist techniques to address this problem for some specific simulation scenarios, there does not yet exist a general approach to reproduce the variety of effects that emerge in reality from fluidair and fluid-solid interactions. In order to address this problem, we present a new surface tension force and a new adhesion force. Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. This property lets our approach handle challenging real scenarios, such as water crown formation, various types of fluid-solid interactions, and even droplet simulations. Furthermore, it prevents particle clustering at the free surface where inter-particle pressure forces are incorrect. Our adhesion force allows plausible two-way attraction of fluids and solids and can be used to model different wetting conditions. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. The forces are applied to the neighboring fluidfluid and fluid-boundary particle pairs in a symmetric way, which satisfies momentum conservation. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way.},

This structure was heavily damaged in January 2020 during the storm Gloria that hit southeastern Spain with remarkable strength. The reconstruction of the pier requires the assessment and characterization of the wave loading that determined the structural failure. Therefore, a state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) code was employed herein as an aid for a planned experimental campaign that will be carried out at the Maritime Engineering Laboratory of Universitat Polit{\`e}cnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech (LIM/UPC). The numerical model is based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and has been employed to simulate conditions very similar to those that manifested during the storm Gloria. The high computational cost for a full 3-D simulation has been alleviated by means of inlet boundary conditions, allowing wave generation very close to the structure. Numerical results reveal forces higher than the design loads of the pier, including both self-weight and accidental loads. This demonstrates that the main failure mechanism that led to severe structural damage of the pier during the storm is related to the exceeded lateral soil resistance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research represents the first known application of SPH open boundary conditions to model a real-world engineering case.},

We propose a real-time Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) based algorithm for realistic computation of the fluid-to-solid coupling problem, which is adequate for a wide generality of cases (solid or hollow objects, with permeable or leak-proof surfaces, and with variable masses). The method incorporates the behaviour of the fluid into which the object is immersed, and decouples the computation of the physical parameters involved in the buoyancy force of the empty object from the mass of contained liquid. The dynamics of this mass of liquid are also computed, in a way such that the relation between the centre of mass of the object and the buoyancy force may vary, leading to complex, realistic beha viours such as the ones arising for instance with a sinking boat.},

In practice the latter is usually the most time-consuming operation due to its inescapable all-to-all communication pattern. The original flups library tackles that issue with an implementation of the distributed Fourier transform tailor-made for successive resolutions of unbounded Poisson problems. However the proposed implementation lacks of flexibility as it only supports cell-centered data layout and features a plain communication strategy. This work extends the library along two directions. First, flups' implementation is generalized to support a node-centered data layout. Second, three distinct approaches are provided to handle the communications: one all-to-all, and two non-blocking implementations relying on manual packing and MPI\_Datatype to communicate over the network. The proposed software is validated against analytical solutions for unbounded, semi-unbounded, and periodic domains. The performance of the approaches is then compared against accFFT, another distributed FFT implementation, using a periodic case. Finally the performance metrics of each implementation are analyzed and detailed on various top-tier European facilities up to 49, 152 cores. This work brings flups up to a fully production-ready and performant distributed FFT library, featuring all the possible types of FFTs and with flexibility in the data-layout.

Our approach employs Moving Least Squares (MLS) to predict the pressure at boundary particles. Therefore, MLS computes hyperplanes that approximate the pressure field at the interface between fluid and boundary particles. We compare this approach with three previous techniques. One previous technique mirrors the pressure from fluid to boundary particles. Another one extrapolates the pressure from fluid to boundary particles, but uses a gradient that is computed with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The third one solves a pressure Poisson equation (PPE) for boundary particles. In our experiments, we indicate artifacts in the three previous approaches. We show that these artifacts are significantly reduced with our approach resulting in simulation steps that can be twice as large. We motivate that gradient-based extrapolation is more accurate than mirroring. We further motivate that, due to particle deficiency at the boundary, the SPH gradient is error prone. This is less the case for our proposed MLS gradient. Moreover, our approach is computationally less expensive as solving a PPE for the boundary particles. We present challenging and complex scenarios to illustrate the capabilities of our method. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed boundary handling is applicable to highly viscous fluids.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium spectral behavior for ocean gravity wind waves has been investigated actively over the past three decades, yet fundamental problems remain in reconciling theory with observations. Predicted equilibrium spectral forms from physical models proposed recently by Kitaigorodskii and by Phillips are examined in the light of wavenumber and frequency spectra reported by several investigators. While frequency domain observations appear to support the model predictions, observed wavenumber spectra are found to differ both in the spectral dependence on wavenumber and on the wind speed. Based on observed wavenumber and frequency spectra for fetch-limited condition a model is proposed for the form of the directional wavenumber spectrum slice in the dominant wave direction. Reduced wavenumber and frequency spectra are calculated from this model, assuming an empirical spectral directional spreading function and the linear gravity wave dispersion relation. These calculations reveal the underlying influences which shape these reduced spectra. In the energy containing subrange, just above the spectral peak, the dominant influence shaping these spectra is the variation of the directional spreading function with distance from the spectral peak. For frequency spectra, at higher frequencies, the model calculations predict that the range of observed frequency spectral dependences is due primarily to the Doppler shifting from advection of the shorter waves by the orbital motion of the dominant waves, with possible additional influences of wind drift and ambient currents. Combining these results, composite calculated frequency spectra and one-dimensional wavenumber spectra show close correspondence with measured field spectra. In addition to clarifying the key processes that shape different regimes in the frequency spectrum, a refinement of the bounds of the gravity equilibrium subrange is proposed.}

Simulating the 3D dynamic motion of such materials represents a challenging problem in graphics because of their unique physical properties. In this paper we present a simple and effective method for granular material simulation. By incorporating techniques from physical models, our approach describes granular phenomena more faithfully than previous methods. Granular material is represented by a large collection of non-spherical particles which may be in persistent contact. The particles represent discrete elements of the simulated material. One major advantage of using discrete elements is that the topology of particle interaction can evolve freely. As a result, highly dynamic phenomena, such as splashing and avalanches, can be conveniently generated by this meshless approach without sacrificing physical accuracy. We generalize this discrete model to rigid bodies by distributing particles over their surfaces. In this way, two-way coupling between granular materials and rigid bodies is achieved.},

  abstract = {A common way to handle boundaries in SPH fluid simulations is to sample the surface of the boundary geometry using particles. These boundary particles are assigned the same properties as the fluid particles and are considered in the pressure force computation to avoid a penetration of the boundary. However, the pressure solver requires a pressure value for each particle. These are typically not computed for the boundary particles due to the computational overhead. Therefore, several strategies have been investigated in previous works to obtain boundary pressure values. A popular, simple technique is pressure mirroring, which mirrors the values from the fluid particles. This method is efficient, but may cause visual artifacts. More complex approaches like pressure extrapolation aim to avoid these artifacts at the cost of computation time. We introduce a constraint-based derivation of Divergence-Free SPH (DFSPH) {\textemdash} a common state-of-the-art pressure solver. This derivation gives us new insights on how to integrate boundary particles in the pressure solve without the need of explicitly computing boundary pressure values. This yields a more elegant formulation of the pressure solver that avoids the aforementioned problems.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method for the efficient and stable simulation of incompressible fluids. The most efficient SPH-based approaches enforce incompressibility either on position or velocity level. However, the continuity equation for incompressible flow demands to maintain a constant density and a divergence-free velocity field. We propose a combination of two novel implicit pressure solvers enforcing both a low volume compression as well as a divergence-free velocity field. While a compression-free fluid is essential for realistic physical behavior, a divergence-free velocity field drastically reduces the number of required solver iterations and increases the stability of the simulation significantly. Thanks to the improved stability, our method can handle larger time steps than previous approaches. This results in a substantial performance gain since the computationally expensive neighborhood search has to be performed less frequently. Moreover, we introduce a third optional implicit solver to simulate highly viscous fluids which seamlessly integrates into our solver framework. Our implicit viscosity solver produces realistic results while introducing almost no numerical damping. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness and scalability of our method in a variety of complex simulations including scenarios with millions of turbulent particles or highly viscous materials.},

Both designs are fully-parameterisable and have been verified against their synthesisable Verilog descriptions. The characteristics and the implementation results of the two hardware architectures on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array are presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first hardware realisation of FFT based on the combined Good-Thomas and Winograd FFT algorithms. The application of the proposed FFT architectures in the physical layer of the long-term evolution wireless standard is discussed.},

  abstract = {When aiming to seamlessly integrate a fluid simulation into a larger scenario (like an open ocean), careful attention must be paid to boundary conditions. In particular, one must implement special "non-reflecting" boundary conditions, which dissipate out-going waves as they exit the simulation. Unfortunately, the state of the art in non-reflecting boundary conditions (perfectly-matched layers, or PMLs) only permits trivially simple inflow/outflow conditions, so there is no reliable way to integrate a fluid simulation into a more complicated environment like a stormy ocean or a turbulent river. This paper introduces the first method for combining non-reflecting boundary conditions based on PMLs with inflow/outflow boundary conditions that vary arbitrarily throughout space and time. Our algorithm is a generalization of state-of-the-art mean-flow boundary conditions in the computational fluid dynamics literature, and it allows for seamless integration of a fluid simulation into much more complicated environments. Our method also opens the door for previously-unseen post-process effects like retroactively changing the location of solid obstacles, and locally increasing the visual detail of a pre-existing simulation.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the computational power of modern cluster machines, numerical simulations can provide, with an unprecedented level of details, new insights into fluid mechanics. However, taking full advantage of this hardware remains challenging since data communication remains a significant bottleneck to reaching peak performances. Reducing floating point precision is a simple and effective way to reduce data movement and improve the computational speed of most applications. Nevertheless, special care needs to be taken to ensure the quality and convergence of computed solutions, especially when dealing with complex fluid simulations. In this work, we analyse the impact of reduced (single and mixed compared to double) precision on computational performance and accuracy for computational fluid dynamics. Using the open source library OpenFOAM, we consider incompressible, compressible, and multiphase fluid solvers for testing on relevant benchmarks for flows in the laminar and turbulent regime and in the presence of shock waves. Computational gain and changes in the scalability of applications in reduced precision are also discussed. In particular, an ad hoc theoretical model for the strong scaling allows us to interpret and understand the observed behaviors, as a function of floating point precision and hardware specifics. Finally, we show how reduced precision can significantly speed up a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, made available to OpenFOAM end-users recently, that simply relies on a GPU linear algebra solver developed by hardware vendors.},

For the coupling we leverage the recent idea of tracking the water surface with a density field in grid based methods. Combining particles and a grid simulation then amounts to adding the density field of the particles and the one stored on the grid. For open scenes, we simulate the water outside of the 3D grid domain by solving the Shallow Water Equations on a height field. We propose new methods to couple these two domains such that waves travel naturally across the border.

Similar to the mode-splitting method (used e.g. in oceanography), we separate the simulation of the low-frequency liquid flow and the high-frequency free surface waves. Hence, the performance for highly detailed liquid simulations can be increased immensely. Thereby, we use the 2D wave equation for surface simulation and the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for describing the liquid flow. Thus, the surface as well as the liquid flow are simulated physically-based, resulting in highly detailed and fully interactive liquid simulations: The liquid flows according to gravity, ground, obstacles and interactions, and the surface interacts with impacts, moving obstacles or simulates the propagation of highly detailed surface waves. Our method obtains realistic results at high framerates. Therefore, it is very suitable for today's video games, VR-Environments or medical simulators.},

To model and animate the ocean's surface, these methods mainly rely on two main approaches: on the one hand, those which approximate ocean dynamics with parametric, spectral or hybrid models and use empirical laws from oceanographic research. We will see that this type of methods essentially allows the simulation of ocean scenes in the deep water domain, without breaking waves. On the other hand, physically-based methods use Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations to represent breaking waves and more generally ocean surface near the shore. We also describe ocean rendering methods in computer graphics, with a special interest in the simulation of phenomena such as foam and spray, and light's interaction with the ocean surface.},

By using all the variables of the real type and quadruple precision (extended precision or Real*16) we were able to, for example, reduce the discretization error from 1.67E-08 to 3.46E-33 with four extrapolations, limited only by the round-off error and, consequently, determining benchmark solutions for the variable of interest {$\psi$}(1/2) using the SPH method. The increase in CPU time and memory usage owing to post-processing was almost null. RRE has proven to be robust in determining up to a sixteenth order of accuracy in meshless discretization for the spatial domain.},

Since the first release back in 2011, DualSPHysics has shown to be robust and accurate for simulating extreme wave events along with a continuous improvement in efficiency thanks to the exploitation of hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) for scientific computing or the coupling with wave propagating models such as SWASH and OceanWave3D. Numerous additional functionalities have also been included in the DualSPHysics package over the last few years which allow the simulation of fluid-driven objects. The use of the discrete element method (DEM) has allowed the solver to simulate the interaction among different bodies (sliding rocks, for example), which provides a unique tool to analyse debris flows. In addition, the recent coupling with other solvers like Project Chrono or MoorDyn has been a milestone in the development of the solver. Project Chrono allows the simulation of articulated structures with joints, hinges, sliders and springs and MoorDyn allows simulating moored structures. Both functionalities make DualSPHysics one of the meshless model world leaders in the simulation of offshore energy harvesting devices. Lately, the present state of maturity of the solver goes beyond single phase simulations, allowing multi-phase simulations with gas-liquid and a combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian models expanding further the capabilities and range of applications for the DualSPHysics solver. These advances and functionalities make DualSPHysics a state-of-the-art meshless solver with emphasis on free-surface flow modelling.},

In order to better obtain photorealism in the behavior of the simulated water surface, we introduce a new ``thickened'' front tracking technique to accurately represent the water surface and a new velocity extrapolation method to move the surface in a smooth, water-like manner. The velocity extrapolation method allows us to provide a degree of control to the surface motion, e.g. to generate a windblown look or to force the water to settle quickly.

Current methods, both in academia and in the industry, simulate an ocean model in frequency space on the GPU, convert said model on an approximately frame-byframe basis to the spatial domain using the Fourier transform, and then read back the resulting heightfield to the CPU as input to the application's physics engine. We propose a fully GPU-based simulation framework that eliminates these GPU readbacks, successfully eliminating the latency-induced simulation errors present in current solutions, while preserving both ocean interactivity and performance. Along this report we also present a prototype of our framework as an Unreal Engine project.    From comparing our proposed framework with the current state of the art, we find:  {\textbullet} a significant correction in simulation accuracy of boats and their wakes;  {\textbullet} near-equivalent GPU performance and improved CPU performance;  {\textbullet} the need to rewrite certain physics behaviors for the GPU that are commonly available as built-in functionality in modern CPU-based physics engines;  {\textbullet} an arguably more complicated implementation.    We conclude that the errors are significant enough to consider in related work and that the proposed approach is worthwhile investigating further in future work.

  abstract = {Solving complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, which are described by nonlinear partial differential equations, is crucial in various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational fluid dynamics based solvers are inadequate to handle the increasing demand for large-scale and long-period simulations. The ever-increasing availability of data and rapid advancement in deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues to tackle these challenges through data-enabled modeling. The seamless integration of DL and classic numerical techniques through the differentiable programming framework can significantly improve data-driven modeling performance. In this study, we propose a differentiable hybrid neural modeling framework for efficient simulation of FSI problems, where the numerically discretized FSI physics based on the immersed boundary method is seamlessly integrated with sequential neural networks using differentiable programming. All modules are programmed in JAX, where automatic differentiation enables gradient back-propagation over the entire model rollout trajectory, allowing the hybrid neural FSI model to be trained as a whole in an end-to-end, sequence-to-sequence manner. Through several FSI benchmark cases, we demonstrate the merit and capability of the proposed method in modeling FSI dynamics for both rigid and flexible bodies. The proposed model has also demonstrated its superiority over baseline purely data-driven neural models, weakly-coupled hybrid neural models, and purely numerical FSI solvers in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.},

The model uses the hybrid finite volume and finite difference method to solve weakly dispersive and nonlinear Boussinesq equations in the horizontal plane, enabling the model to have the shock-capturing ability to deal with breaking waves and moving shoreline properly. The code is written in CUDA C. To achieve better performance, the model uses cyclic reduction technique to solve massive tridiagonal linear systems and overlapped tiling/shared memory to reduce global memory access and enhance data reuse. Four numerical tests are conducted to validate the GPU implementation. The performance of the GPU model is evaluated by running a series of numerical simulations on two GPU platforms with different hardware configurations. Compared with the CPU version, the maximum speedup ratios for single-precision and double-precision calculations are 55.56 and 32.57, respectively.},

While our method focuses on maxi- mizing performance in fixed-radius SPH simulations, we show that it can also be used in scenarios where the particle support radius is not constant thanks to the adaptive nature of the octree acceleration structure. possible followed by direct distance comparisons between the remaining particle pairs. the of an effort to minimize the actual computation time, we find that distance com- parisons exhibit very high throughput on modern CPUs. By permitting more comparisons than strictly necessary, the time spent on preparing and search- ing the acceleration structure can be reduced, yielding a net positive speedup. The choice of an octree acceleration structure, instead of the uniform grid typically used in fixed-radius methods, ensures balanced computational tasks. This benefits both parallelism and provides consistently high com- putational intensity for the distance comparisons. We present a detailed account of high-level considerations that, together with low-level decisions, enable high throughput for performance-critical parts of the algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the high performance of our algorithm on a number of large-scale fixed-radius SPH benchmarks and show in experiments with a support radius ratio up to 3 that our method is also effective in multi-resolution SPH simulations.},

The framework can be either fully Lagrangian, Eulerian or realizing arbitary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) feature enforcing the isotropic particle distribution in specific cases. In the proposed framework, the computational domain is divided into smooth regions and non-smooth regions, and these two regions are determined by a strong scale separation strategy in the targeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme. In smooth regions, the moving-least-square (MLS) approximation is used for evaluating high-order derivative operator, which is able to realize genuine high-order construction; in non-smooth regions, the new TENO scheme based on Vila's framework with several new improvements will be deployed to capture discontinuities and high-wavenumber flow scales with low numerical dissipation. The present MLS-TENO-SPH method is validated with a set of challenging cases based on the Eulerian, Lagrangian or ALE framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the MLS-TENO-SPH method features lower numerical dissipation and higher efficiency than the conventional method, and can restore genuine high-order accuracy in smooth regions. Overall, the proposed framework serves as a new exploration in high-order SPH methods, which are potential for compressible flow simulations with shockwaves.},

  abstract = {In a fully developed sea, the significant wave height (Hs) and wind speed (U10) are conventionally related to a pure quadratic equation. This relation is often violated, since in the field the measured local Hs is often contaminated by the swell, which is propagated from distant places. Therefore, a swell partition is required before the establishment of the wind-wave relation. The Spectra Energy Partition (SEP) is regarded as the best way to isolate the swell and the wind wave relation: it is based on the identification of a separation frequency in the ocean wave spectrum. However, for most field observations, the wave spectra information is unavailable, and thus the SEP is inapplicable. This work proposes a probability-based algorithm to identify the averaged swell without knowing the wave spectrum a priori. The local wind-wave relation is established by either a linear or an energy-conserved decomposition. We also find that the local wind-wave relation is a power-law when the wind speed U10 is above 4 m/s. The proposed method is first validated by applying the SEP method to buoy collected wave spectra data. The global pattern of the swell and the local wind waves is retrieved by applying the proposed method to a 17-year wind and wave database from the JASON satellite. Strong seasonal and spatial variations are obtained. Finally, a prediction model based on the empirical wind-wave relation is shown to successfully retrieve the wave field when the wind field is available.},

The approach interlinks the iterative pressure update at fluid particles with a second SPH solver that computes artificial pressure at rigid-body particles. The introduced SPH rigid-body solver models rigid-rigid contacts as artificial density deviations at rigid-body particles. The corresponding pressure is iteratively computed by solving a global formulation that is particularly useful for large numbers of rigid-rigid contacts. Compared to previous SPH coupling methods, the proposed concept stabilizes the fluid-rigid interface handling. It significantly reduces the computation times of SPH fluid simulations by enabling larger time steps. Performance gain factors of up to 58 compared to previous methods are presented. We illustrate the flexibility of the presented fluid-rigid coupling by integrating it into DFSPH, IISPH, and a recent SPH solver for highly viscous fluids. We further show its applicability to a recent SPH solver for elastic objects. Large scenarios with up to 90M particles of various interacting materials and complex contact geometries with up to 90k rigid-rigid contacts are shown. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed rigid-body solver by comparing it to Bullet.},

  abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is the most widely established mesh-free method which has been used in several fields as astrophysics, solids mechanics and fluid dynamics. In the particular case of computational fluid dynamics, the model is beginning to reach a maturity that allows carrying out detailed quantitative comparisons with laboratory experiments. Here the state-of-the-art of the classical SPH formulation for free-surface flow problems is described in detail. This is demonstrated using dam-break simulations in 2-D and 3-D. The foundations of the method will be presented using different derivations based on the method of interpolants and on the moving least-squares approach. Different methods to improve the classic SPH approach such as the use of density filters and the corrections of the kernel function and its gradient are examined and tested on some laboratory cases.},

  abstract = {Parallelism is often required for performance. In these situations an excess of non-determinism is harmful as it means the program can have several different behaviours or even different results. Even in domains such as high-performance computing where parallelism is crucial for performance, the computed value should be deterministic. Unfortunately, non-determinism in programs also allows dynamic scheduling of tasks, reacting to the first task that succeeds, cancelling tasks that cannot lead to a result, etc. Non-determinism is thus both a desired asset or an undesired property depending on the situation. In practice, it is often necessary to limit non-determinism and to identify precisely the sources of non-determinism in order to control what parts of a program are deterministic or not. This survey takes the perspective of programming languages, and studies how programming models can ensure the determinism of parallel programs. This survey studies not only deterministic languages but also programming models that prevent one particularly demanding source of non-determinism: data races. Our objective is to compare existing solutions to the following questions: How programming languages can help programmers write programs that run in a parallel manner without visible non-determinism? What programming paradigms ensure this kind of properties? We study these questions and discuss the merits and limitations of different approaches.},

This paper presents novel and efficient strategies to spatially adapt the amount of computational effort applied based on the local dynamics of a free surface flow, for both classic weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) and predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH). Using a convenient and readily parallelizable block-based approach, different regions of the fluid are assigned differing time steps and solved at different rates to minimize computational cost. Our approach for WCSPH scheme extends an asynchronous SPH technique from compressible flow of astrophysical phenomena to the incompressible free surface setting, and further accelerates it by entirely decoupling the time steps of widely spaced particles. Similarly, our approach to PCISPH adjusts the the number of iterations of density correction applied to different regions, and asynchronously updates the neighborhood regions used to perform these corrections; this sharply reduces the computational cost of slowly deforming regions while preserving the standard density invariant. We demonstrate our approaches on a number of highly dynamic scenarios, demonstrating that they can typically double the speed of a simulation compared to standard methods while achieving visually consistent results.},

The crucial particle neighborhood search is based on Z-indexing and parallel sorting which eliminates GPU memory overhead due to grid or hierarchical data structures. Furthermore, it overcomes limitations imposed by shading languages allowing it to be very flexible and approaching the practical limits of modern graphics hardware. For visualizing the SPH simulation we introduce a new rendering pipeline. In the first step, all surface particles are efficiently extracted from the SPH particle cloud exploiting the simulation data. Subsequently, a partial and therefore fast distance field volume is rasterized from the surface particles. In the last step, the distance field volume is directly rendered using state-of-the-art GPU raycasting. This rendering pipeline allows for high quality visualization at very high frame rates.},

In order to find nearest neighbors for all particles, hash-based, grid-based or tree-based approaches have been developed in the past. The two most prominent and fastest algorithms use virtual and explicitly allocated uniform grids to achieve high performance on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, they have disadvantages with numerous particle simulation domains, either in terms of run time or memory consumption. We present a novel algorithm that can be applied to large simulation domains that significantly reduces memory consumption using a shared-memory based neighbor search.

It is significant to study the 6-DOF motion for simulating the trajectory and impact load of structures. This paper uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method combined with some modified numerical techniques to simulate the fluid-solid interactions (FSI), then a quaternion-based method is adopted to simulate the free motion of rigid bodies, where the calculation process of 6-DOF motions based on quaternion is elaborated in detail. The accuracy of this method is verified through two benchmark tests, including water entry of a cuboid and skipping stone, which can prove the pressure calculation and motion prediction of rigid bodies are consistent with the experimental results. At last, the 6-DOF ditching process of a seaplane is simulated by the quaternion method embedded in the SPH model, and the simulation results are consistent with those simulated by the finite volume method (FVM). The above three tests demonstrate that the SPH model combined with a 6-DOF quaternion-based solver can accurately solve FSI problems from basic to complex at different scales. Besides, the SPH model shows significant advantages in capturing large-deformed free surfaces and splashing droplets compared with Eulerian-grid-based methods.},

The ISPH model is first verified against a theoretical model of wave propagation over a porous bed and then further validated by comparing the predicted wave surface profiles and flow velocity fields with the experiment data for a typical case of flow motion around and inside a submerged porous structure. The good agreement has demonstrated that the improved ISPH model developed in this work is capable of modelling wave interaction with porous structures.},

Firstly, the internal velocity of the bubble was avoided, and the bubble model was established by only considering the net flux of the inlet and outlet bubbles, which reduced the computational complexity. The bubble constraint was then introduced into the motion equation of water, and the mixed Euler{\textendash}Lagrangian method was used to solve it. FLIP particles tracked the bubble position, velocity, and deformation, and the mesh updated the vector field. At the same time, the viscosity term was simplified. Finally, it was combined with implicit incompressible SPH particles to achieve the purpose of volume correction. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can present a simulation effect of bubbles in water with rich detail and a realistic sense, whether compared with actual pictures or with existing methods.},

Fluid Mech. 649, 205-231 (2010)] for computing hydrodynamic interactions among particles confined to a doubly-periodic geometry with either a single bottom wall or two walls (slit channel) in the aperiodic direction. Our spectrally-accurate Stokes solver uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in the periodic \$xy\$ plane and Chebyshev polynomials in the aperiodic \$z\$ direction normal to the wall(s). We decompose the problem into two subproblems. The first is a doubly-periodic system in the presence of particles (source terms) with free-space boundary conditions in the \$z\$ direction, which we solve by borrowing ideas from a recent method for rapid evaluation of electrostatic interactions in doubly-periodic geometries [O. Maxian, R. P. Pelaez, L. Greengard and A. Donev, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 204107 (2021)]. The second is a correction subproblem to impose the boundary conditions on the wall(s). Instead of the traditional Gaussian kernel, we use the exponential of a semicircle kernel to model the source terms (body force) due to the presence of particles, and provide optimum values for the kernel parameters that ensure a given hydrodynamic radius with at least two digits of accuracy and rotational and translational invariance. The computation time of our solver, which is implemented in graphical processing units, scales linearly with the number of particles, and allows computations with about a million particles in less than a second for a sedimented layer of colloidal microrollers.},

  abstract = {The conventional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is inherently an explicit scheme; the modeling of weakly compressible flows must imply an equation of state to link the mass density with the pressure. Unfortunately, the SPH scheme has an outstandingly high computational performance requirement, especially in the case of small time step sizes applied due to the large stiffness. Therefore in practice, the speed of sound is usually reduced artificially to meet the requirements of the given fluid flow problem in terms of the compressibility rate. Unfortunately, this approach still demands very low time step sizes in most cases. In this paper, we introduce an excessively simple improvement of the weakly compressible variant of the SPH scheme to achieve a considerably stiffer fluid without the demand for a smaller time step size and additional computational requirement. The present work's motivation was to eliminate the remnant density variance under constant pressure by introducing an integral and differential term in the equation of state analogously with Proportional{\^a}A{\textasciibreve} S{\c} Integral{\^a}A{\textasciibreve} S{\c} Derivative (PID) controls. The model was tested through simple two-dimensional hydrostatic and dam break cases.},

The advancement of our spectra over the spectrum described by Tessendorf is that it readily gives plausible, attractive results for a wide range of wind speeds, ocean depths, and other physical parameters, without requiring artists to manually adjust gain and filter parameters to compensate for model inaccuracies. Our "swell" parameter additionally provides an intuitive interface for smoothly varying between choppy seas due to local storms and swells from distant weather events.},

  abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is widely accepted as a flexible numerical treatment for surface boundaries and interactions. High-resolution simulations of hydrodynamic events require high-performance computing (HPC). There is a need for an SPH code that runs efficiently on modern supercomputers involving accelerators such as NVIDIA or AMD graphics processing units. In this work, we applied half-precision, which is widely used in artificial intelligence, to the SPH method. However, improving HPC performance at such low-order precisions is a challenge. An as-is implementation with half-precision will have lower computational cost than that of float/double precision simulations, but also worsens the simulation accuracy. We propose a scaling and shifting method that maintains the simulation accuracy near the level of float/double precision. By examining the impact of half-precision on the simulation accuracy and time-to-solution, we demonstrated that the use of half-precision can improve the computational performance of SPH simulations for scientific purposes without sacrificing the accuracy. In addition, we demonstrated that the efficiency of half-precision depends on the architecture used.},

  abstract = {The simulation of large open water surface is challenging using a uniform volumetric discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Simulating water splashes near moving objects, which height field methods for water waves cannot capture, necessitates high resolutions. Such simulations can be carried out using the Fluid-Implicit-Particle (FLIP) method. However, the FLIP method is not efficient for the long-lasting water waves that propagate to long distances, which require sufficient depth for a correct dispersion relationship. This paper presents a new method to tackle this dilemma through an efficient hybridization of volumetric and surface-based advection-projection discretizations. We design a hybrid time-stepping algorithm that combines a FLIP domain and an adaptively remeshed Boundary Element Method (BEM) domain for the incompressible Euler equations. The resulting framework captures the detailed water splashes near moving objects with the FLIP method, and produces convincing water waves with correct dispersion relationships at modest additional costs.},

Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

Our contribution is the derivation and implementation of an implicit cohesion force based approach for the simulation of surface tension effects using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We define a continuous formulation inspired by the properties of surface tension at the molecular scale which is spatially discretized using SPH. An adapted variant of the linearized backward Euler method is used for time discretization, which we also strongly couple with an implicit viscosity model. Finally, we extend our formulation with adhesion forces for interfaces with rigid objects.             Existing SPH approaches for surface tension in computer graphics are mostly based on explicit time integration, thereby lacking in stability for challenging settings. We compare our implicit surface tension method to these approaches and further evaluate our model on a wider variety of complex scenarios, showcasing its efficacy and versatility. Among others, these include but are not limited to simulations of a water crown, a dripping faucet and a droplet-toy.},

At the same time, it is also useful for practicing system designers and embedded programmers. The book assumes the reader has a working knowledge of C/C++ and includes a significant amount of sample code. In addition, we assume familiarity with basic computer architecture concepts (pipelining, speedup, Amdahl's Law, etc.).

These simulations are complex and represent a considerable runtime effort to obtain trajectory results, which is the prime motivation for enhancing the performance of Lagrangian particle simulators. This paper analyses and compares established performance enhancing technique from Eulerian simulators with the computational conditions and demands of Lagrangian simulators. A performance enhancement strategy specifically targeting physics-based Lagrangian particle simulations is outlined to address the performance gaps, and techniques for closing the performance gap are presented and implemented. Realistic experiments are derived from three specific oceanographic application scenarios, and the suggested performance-enhancing techniques are benchmarked in detail, so to allow for a good attribution of speed-up measurements to individual techniques. The impacts and insights from the performance enhancement strategy are further discussed for Lagrangian simulations in other geoscientific applications. The experiments show that I/O-enhancing techniques, such as dynamic loading and buffering, lead to considerable speed-up on-par with an idealised parallelisation of the process over 20 nodes. Conversely, alternative data structures to a CPU cache-efficient structure-of-arrays do not fulfill the theoretically-expected performance increase, which also demonstrates the importance of good cache alignment for Lagrangian physics simulations.},

  abstract = {Water is an important part of nature. Interactively simulating large areas of flowing water would be a welcome addition to many virtual worlds, but the simulation is computationally demanding. Another problem is combining the simulation with rigid bodies, which are the most common interaction solution in virtual worlds. Heightfield water simulation is fast, but is especially hard to couple with rigid bodies: Usually water simply flows through the bodies. We propose a method that generalizes the extremely fast virtual pipe method to handle large, dynamic bodies. Our method diverts water around the objects. This enables us, for example, to dynamically build and destroy dams on rivers in a large virtual world.}

Allowing the water to interact with rigid bodies is essential for applications such as games, but traditional heightfield interaction methods concentrate on water-to-body effects by letting water flow through the bodies. We instead take an approach where the bodies block water. Our earlier method is improved in several ways, taking steps toward a single method to create both water-to-body and body-to-water effects. The new method is also visually compared to a traditional method by Th{\"u}rey et al. A drawback of our method is that it has some grid aliasing artifacts that appear especially when the method is used for floating bodies. However, our method is demonstrated to work together with the Th{\"u}rey method, which allows us to get the best of both worlds to simulate both floating and blocking bodies in a single scene. The method runs in real time for large areas of water even with a very limited GPU budget.},

  abstract = {In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to accelerate numerical simulations using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)s. In multiphysics simulations, the various combined methodologies may have distinctly different computational characteristics. Therefore, the best-suited hardware architecture can differ between the simulation components. Furthermore, not all coupled software frameworks may support all hardware. These issues predestinate or even force hybrid implementations, i.e., different simulation components running on different hardware. We introduce a hybrid coupled fluid-particle implementation with geometrically resolved particles. The simulation utilizes GPUs for the fluid dynamics, whereas the particle simulation runs on Central Processing Unit (CPU)s. We examine the performance of two contrasting cases of a fluidized bed simulation on a heterogeneous supercomputer. The hybrid overhead (i.e., the CPU-GPU communication) is negligible. The fluid simulation shows good performance utilizing nearly the entire memory bandwidth. Still, the GPU run time accounts for most of the total time. The parallel efficiency in a weak scaling benchmark for 1024 A100 GPUs is up to 71\%. Frequent CPU-CPU communications occurring in the particle simulation are the leading cause of the decrease in parallel efficiency. The results show that hybrid implementations are promising for large-scale multiphysics simulations on heterogeneous supercomputers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the novel concept of density maps for robust handling of static and rigid dynamic boundaries in fluid simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). In contrast to the vast majority of existing approaches, we use an implicit discretization for a continuous extension of the density field throughout solid boundaries. Using the novel representation we enhance accuracy and efficiency of density and density gradient evaluations in boundary regions by computationally efficient lookups into our density maps. The map is generated in a preprocessing step and discretizes the density contribution in the boundary's near-field. In consequence of the high regularity of the continuous boundary density field, we use cubic Lagrange polynomials on a narrow-band structure of a regular grid for discretization. This strategy not only removes the necessity to sample boundary surfaces with particles but also decouples the particle size from the number of sample points required to represent the boundary. Moreover, it solves the ever-present problem of particle deficiencies near the boundary. In several comparisons we show that the representation is more accurate than particle samplings, especially for smooth curved boundaries. We further demonstrate that our approach robustly handles scenarios with highly complex boundaries and even outperforms one of the most recent sampling based techniques.},

The variety and impact of recent research based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) demonstrates the concept's importance as one of the most versatile tools for the simulation of fluids and solids. With this survey, we offer an overview of the developments and still-active research on physics simulation methodologies based on SPH that has not been addressed in previous SPH surveys. Following an introduction about typical SPH discretization techniques, we provide an overview over the most used incompressibility solvers and present novel insights regarding their relation and conditional equivalence. The survey further covers recent advances in implicit and particle-based boundary handling and sampling techniques. While SPH is best known in the context of fluid simulation we discuss modern concepts to augment the range of simulatable physical characteristics including turbulence, highly viscous matter, deformable solids, as well as rigid body contact handling. Besides the purely numerical approaches, simulation techniques aided by machine learning are on the rise. Thus, the survey discusses recent data-driven approaches and the impact of differentiable solvers on artist control. Finally, we provide context for discussion by outlining existing problems and opportunities to open up new research directions.},

  abstract = {Highly accurate and precise heave decay tests on a sphere with a diameter of 300 mm were completed in a meticulously designed test setup in the wave basin in the Ocean and Coastal Engineering Laboratory at Aalborg University, Denmark. The tests were dedicated to providing a rigorous benchmark dataset for numerical model validation. The sphere was ballasted to half submergence, thereby floating with the waterline at the equator when at rest in calm water. Heave decay tests were conducted, wherein the sphere was held stationary and dropped from three drop heights: a small drop height, which can be considered a linear case, a moderately nonlinear case, and a highly nonlinear case with a drop height from a position where the whole sphere was initially above the water. The precision of the heave decay time series was calculated from random and systematic standard uncertainties. At a 95\% confidence level, uncertainties were found to be very low{\textemdash}on average only about 0.3\% of the respective drop heights. Physical parameters of the test setup and associated uncertainties were quantified. A test case was formulated that closely represents the physical tests, enabling the reader to do his/her own numerical tests. The paper includes a comparison of the physical test results to the results from several independent numerical models based on linear potential flow, fully nonlinear potential flow, and the Reynolds-averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes (RANS) equations. A high correlation between physical and numerical test results is shown. The physical test results are very suitable for numerical model validation and are public as a benchmark dataset.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for coupling the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and the finite element method (FEM) is proposed for fluid{\textendash}structure interaction (FSI) problems. The SPH module solves the fluid motion, and the FEM module describes the deformation of structures. In the algorithm, a structure is considered as a solid boundary in the SPH module and dealt with using the dynamic boundary condition. Only three layers of SPH boundary particles are set to represent the structure surface, and the interaction forces between the SPH boundary and fluid particles, including the water pressure and the viscous shear stress, are quantified in a same way as the inter-fluid particle forces. Further, the computed forces on the SPH boundary particles exerted by the fluid are redistributed to the structure FEM nodes based on a well-defined projection scheme. In the FEM module, the deformation and motion of the structure under the exerted fluid forces are solved, and accordingly, the position and velocity of the SPH boundary particles are updated by interpolation from the new properties at the FEM nodes. The proposed SPH-FEM coupled model is validated in three FSI benchmarks. For the deformation of an elastic plate under hydrostatic water pressure, the relative difference between the computed and the analytical maximum vertical displacement at the plate midpoint is about 1.5\%. For the deformation of an elastic gate subjected to a time-varying dam-break flow, the relative root mean squared errors in the computed vertical and horizontal displacement of the gate are, respectively, 5.5\% and 2.2\%. It is demonstrated that the proposed model performs well in simulating the deformation of structures under both hydrostatic water pressure and dynamic impacts of dam-break flows.},

In this paper, a novel, incompressible fluid simulation framework based on the divergence-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model is presented. The novel SPH model combines a system of non-linear density constraint conditions and the divergence-free velocity field condition to enforce fluid incompressibility. In the new framework, the position of particles is firstly modified by solving the density constraints, and the distribution of particles is adjusted to keep the density of fluid in a relatively constant state. Then the divergence-free state increases the stability significantly and reduces the number of solver iterations. Compared to the modern Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) solvers, the new SPH framework allows better incompressibility and similar convergence. Finally, the method of pre-computed smoothing kernel functions is used to accelerate the proposed SPH model. It can effectively improve the real-time performance of the algorithm while maintaining sufficient accuracy.}

One major disadvantage is the lack of adaptiveness, which may compromise accuracy in fluid regions such as splashes and surfaces. Attempts to address this problem used variable smoothing lengths. Yet the existing methods are computationally complex and non-efficient, because the smoothing length is typically calculated using iterative optimization. Here, we propose an efficient non-iterative SPH fluid simulation method with variable smoothing length (VSLSPH). VSLSPH correlates the smoothing length to the density change, and adaptively adjusts the smoothing length of particles with high accuracy and low computational cost, enabling large time steps. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the VSLSPH approach in terms of its simulation accuracy and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Micro-scale fluids are tiny droplets that adhere to the surface of an object as a result of rainfall, perspiration, etc. Micro-scale fluid simulation is widely used in fields such as film and games. The existing state-of-the-art simulation methods are not suitable for simulating water droplets moving on a surface due to the fact that the water droplets cannot leave the texture space and their movements always depend on the continuous UV region. In this study, a novel method for simulating water droplets moving on a surface is proposed. We divide the droplets into two types: (1) two-dimensional droplets and (2) three-dimensional droplets and we implement the transformation between two-dimensional droplets in the texture space and three-dimensional droplets in the physical space. In the preprocessing phase, jump textures, coordinate transform textures and force field textures are generated in the non-continuous UV regions on a 3D object's surface. In the process of simulation, water droplets are treated as rigid particles. The Velocity-Verlet-based method is adopted to solve the motion trajectory equation, and the boundary droplet transport algorithm is implemented based on jump texture. In the process of rendering, the height map is generated according to the simulation in the texture space and then the liquid bridge phenomenon between the droplets is simulated based on the Gaussian blur and the color rank algorithm. Finally, they are converted into normal texture-rendering droplets. The experimental result shows that the proposed method works well when simulating the movements of water droplets on a surface in a real-time manner, and it makes the movement simulation of dimension-reducing water droplets no longer depend on the continuous surface and continuous UV region. Moreover, the simulation efficiency of the proposed method is two times higher than that of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method.},

  abstract = {Modern video games employ a variety of sophisticated algorithms to produce groundbreaking 3D rendering of water, which are pushing the visual boundaries and interactive experience of rich virtual environments. However, simulation and rendering of a large number of water particles is very time consuming and it is very hard to achieve real-time frame rate (due to the huge computational cost required), e.g., those found in feature movies and offline products [Flip Fluids2022], or tools (e.g., Houdini and Blender). That is why most water visual effects in modern games are either simulated as only a 2D shallow-water in which simulation is calculated in 2D grid and projected onto the heightfield, as in [Fluid Flux 2022], or are baked at preprocessing stage which does not allow the player to dynamically interact with the liquid at runtime, as a result, lots of the fun of interactivity is lost. This course will discuss the state-of-the-art and production-proven techniques involved in building a real-time system on GPUs for simulation and rendering of realistic 3D liquid with millions of particles. It also discusses how to integrate the system into modern game engines (like UE5), with some show-cases of real applications in gaming environments.},

  abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic simulation system using the GPU compute shaders of DirectX for simulating virtual agent behaviors and navigation inside a smoothed particle hydrodynamical (SPH) fluid environment with real-time water mesh surface reconstruction. The current SPH literature includes interactions between SPH and heterogeneous meshes but seldom involves interactions between SPH and virtual boid agents. The contribution of the system lies in the combination of the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics model with the distributed boid model of virtual agents to enable agents to interact with fluids. The agents based on the boid algorithm influence the motion of SPH fluid particles, and the forces from the SPH algorithm affect the movement of the boids. To enable realistic fluid rendering and simulation in a particle-based system, it is essential to construct a mesh from the particle attributes. Our system also contributes to the surface reconstruction aspect of the pipeline, in which we performed a set of experiments with the parallel marching cubes algorithm per frame for constructing the mesh from the fluid particles in a real-time compute and memoryintensive application, producing a wide range of triangle configurations. We also demonstrate that our system is versatile enough for reinforced robotic agents instead of boid agents to interact with the fluid environment for underwater navigation and remote control engineering purposes.},

  abstract = {Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is the core of many fields of science and engineering. While classical approaches are often prohibitively slow, machine learning models often fail to incorporate complete system information. Over the past few years, transformers have had a significant impact on the field of Artificial Intelligence and have seen increased usage in PDE applications. However, despite their success, transformers currently lack integration with physics and reasoning. This study aims to address this issue by introducing PITT: Physics Informed Token Transformer. The purpose of PITT is to incorporate the knowledge of physics by embedding partial differential equations (PDEs) into the learning process. PITT uses an equation tokenization method to learn an analytically-driven numerical update operator. By tokenizing PDEs and embedding partial derivatives, the transformer models become aware of the underlying knowledge behind physical processes. To demonstrate this, PITT is tested on challenging PDE neural operators in both 1D and 2D prediction tasks. The results show that PITT outperforms the popular Fourier Neural Operator and has the ability to extract physically relevant information from governing equations.},

  abstract = {As waves interact with the slopes of coral reefs and other steep bathymetry profiles, plunging breaking usually occurs where the free surface overturns and violent water motion is triggered. Resolving these surf zone processes pose significant challenges for conventional mesh-based hydrodynamic models, due to the rapidly-deforming nature of the free surface and associated flows. Yet the accurate prediction of these surf zone hydrodynamics is critical for predicting a wide range of nearshore processes driven by wave breaking (e.g., wave dissipation and energy transfers; mean water levels and currents; and wave runup). In this study we assess the ability of the mesh-free, Lagrangian particle-based numerical modelling approach Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) based on DualSPHysics, to simulate the fine-scale hydrodynamic processes driven by irregular wave transformation over a fringing reef profile, by comparing results against detailed experimental observations from a physical modelling study. To greatly improve the computational efficiency, the SPH model was coupled to the mesh-based multi-layer nonhydrostatic wave-flow model SWASH. With this coupled approach, SWASH was used to efficiently simulate the evolution of non-breaking waves from the wavemaker up to the fore reef slope, with the SPH model then used to simulate the detailed hydrodynamic processes over the reef from just offshore of the breakpoint to the shoreline. The SPH model was able to accurately reproduce the complex free surface deformations during plunging breaking, the spectral evolution of waves across the reef flat (including nonlinear wave shape), the mean water levels and currents, and wave runup at the shoreline. Using the long duration simulations ({$>$}400 wave periods), the model was able to reproduce the full range of wave motions over the reef (from sea-swell to infragravity frequencies), including the increasing dominance of low frequency waves towards the shoreline and the large cross-reef standing wave motions excited by the reef geometry.},

The problems are placed into three categories according to their physical characteristics, namely, wave hydrodynamics and corresponding mass (air, oil, etc.) transport, wave-structure interaction, and wave-current-sediment interaction. For the first category, particle-based simulations of wave generation, propagation, breaking, as well as the associated turbulence production and dissipation, air entrainment, and mass transport, are reviewed. For wave-structure interaction, extensive structural types are considered that include fixed and moving (floating) structures, rigid and deformable structures, impermeable and porous structures, etc. For the third category, the latest advances of particle methods in wave/current interaction with sediments, i.e., sediment transport and coastal morphological changes, are outlined. This article also reviews the latest developments of particle methods with respect to enhancement of numerical stability, accuracy, efficiency and consistency in order to handle the multi-physics and multi-scale problems emerging from coastal and ocean engineering practices. Finally, the future perspectives of extending particle methods to a wider range of ocean and coastal engineering applications are highlighted.},

We make the surprising observation that performing a single large time step with n constraint solver iterations is less effective than computing n smaller time steps, each with a single constraint solver iteration. Based on this observation, our approach is to split every visual time step into n substeps of length {$\increment$}t/n and to perform a single iteration of extended position-based dynamics (XPBD) in each such substep. When compared to a traditional implicit integrator with large time steps we find constraint error and damping are significantly reduced. When compared to an explicit integrator we find that our method is more stable and robust for a wider range of stiffness parameters. This result holds even when compared against more sophisticated implicit solvers based on Krylov methods. Our method is straightforward to implement, and is not sensitive to matrix conditioning nor is it to overconstrained problems.},

Good examples are the motion of a ship in the presence of water waves and the motion of a rigid structure in the presence of seismic waves. The basic goals are to determine the motion of the rigid body and the effects of the motion on the wave field, assuming linear theory is adequate. Although the underlying mathematical problems are similar, several solution methods have evolved, depending on the physical problems of interest. For ship motions, the standard approach is to decompose the problem into seven subproblems, one for each of the six rigid-body modes and one to take account of the incident wave. This approach is reviewed and then adapted to problems in acoustics and to problems in elastodynamics, such as those that arise in simple examples of soil{\textendash}structure interaction. It is argued that the resulting approach for elastodynamic problems has clear advantages over those currently in use.},

And this is all to the good, because it means that parallel programming is becoming an engineering discipline. Therefore, as befits an engineering discipline, this book examines specific parallel-programming tasks and describes how to approach them. In some surprisingly common cases, these tasks can be automated. This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering discipline underlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation of parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old wheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new frontiers. However, what you get from this book will be determined by what you put into it. It is hoped that simply reading this book will be helpful, and that working the Quick Quizzes will be even more helpful. However, the best results come from applying the techniques taught in this book to real-life problems. As always, practice makes perfect. But no matter how you approach it, we sincerely hope that parallel programming brings you at least as much fun, excitement, and challenge that it has brought to us!},

  abstract = {Controlling fluids is still an open and challenging problem in fluid animation. In this paper we develop a novel fluid animation control approach and we present its application to controlling breaking waves. In our Slice Method framework an animator defines the shape of a breaking wave at a desired moment in its evolution based on a library of breaking waves. Our system computes then the subsequent dynamics with the aid of a 3D Navier-Stokes solver. The wave dynamics previous to the moment the animator exerts control can also be generated based on the wave library. The animator is thus enabled to obtain a full animation of a breaking wave while controlling the shape and the timing of the breaking. An additional advantage of the method is that it provides a significantly faster method for obtaining the full 3D breaking wave evolution compared to starting the simulation at an early stage and using solely the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. We present a series of 2D and 3D breaking wave animations to demonstrate the power of the method.},

  abstract = {Abstract Analysis of the directional spectra of typical sets of surface wave data obtained in the open sea as well asa bay using a cloverleaf buoy system are reported. It is shown that the directional wave spectrum can be approximated by the product of the frequencyspectrum and a unimodal angular distribution with mean direction approximately equal to that of thewind, and that various forms of frequency spectra exist, even in relatively simple wave systems, dependingon their generating conditions. Ocean waves at fairly short dimensionless fetches show spectral forms withvery narrow spectral width, which are similar to those of laboratory wind waves. On the other hand, thespectral forms for ocean waves at very long dimensionless fetches are quite similar to the Pierson-Moskowitzspectra, which are considered, within our present data, to be the wave spectra with the largest spectral width.Finally, there exist many ocean waves at moderate dimensionless fetches, which show spectral forms with interminate spectral widths lying between the above two extremes. However, a definite relationship betweenthe spectral width and the dimensionless fetch has not been obtained in the present study. Concerning the angular distribution, it is shown that the shape of the angular distribution is dependenton the frequency of the spectral component even in a simple wave system in a generating area, althoughthe mean directions ot the spectral components are independent of the frequency and approximately equalto the wind direction. The angular distribution is very narrow for frequencies near the dominant peak of thefrequency spectrum, whereas it widens rapidly toward high and low frequencies. Thus, the major energy-containing frequency components propagate in almost the same direction as the wind with the least angularspreading. Finally, it is shown that a similarity law is satisfied for the angular distributions, and an idealized formof the angular distribution function is derived for practical purposes.},

In this paper, we introduce PINNs at an elementary level, mainly oriented to physics education so making them suitable for educational purposes at both undergraduate and graduate levels. PINNs can be used to create virtual simulations and educational tools that aid in understating complex physical concepts and processes where differential equations are involved. By combining the power of neural networks with physics principles, PINNs can provide an interactive and engaging learning experience that can improve students' understanding and retention of physics concepts in higher education.},

This classic textbook, originally published in 1977, filled the need for a single volume on the applications of hydrodynamics to marine problems. The book is solidly based on fundamentals, but it also guides the student to an understanding of engineering applications through its consideration of realistic configurations. The book takes a balanced approach between theory and empirics, providing the necessary theoretical background for an intelligent evaluation and application of empirical procedures. It also serves as an introduction to more specialized research methods. It unifies the seemingly diverse problems of marine hydrodynamics by examining them not as separate problems but as related applications of the general field of hydrodynamics. The book evolved from a first-year graduate course in MIT's Department of Ocean Engineering. A knowledge of advanced calculus is assumed. Students will find a previous introductory course in fluid dynamics helpful, but the book presents the necessary fundamentals in a self-contained manner.

To this end, we propose an efficient GPU streaming pipeline to map the entire computational task onto the GPU, fully exploiting the massive computational power of state-of-the-art GPUs. In PCISPH-based simulations, neighbor search is the major performance obstacle because this process is performed several times at each time step. To eliminate this bottleneck, an efficient parallel sorting method for this time-consuming step is introduced. Moreover, we discuss several optimization techniques including using fast on-chip shared memory to avoid global memory bandwidth limitations and thus further improve performance on modern GPU hardware. With our framework, the realism of real-time fluid simulation is significantly improved since our method enforces incompressibility constraint which is typically ignored due to efficiency reason in previous GPU-based SPH methods. The performance results illustrate that our approach can efficiently simulate realistic incompressible fluid in real time and results in a speed-up factor of up to 23 on a high-end NVIDIA GPU in comparison to single-threaded CPU-based implementation.},

We use graph-based approaches to model differentiating cells, which provides a spatio-temporal characterization of developmental trajectories and defines the transcriptional architecture that accompanies the emergence of the first (primitive or extra-embryonic) endodermal population and its sister pluripotent (embryonic) epiblast lineage. We uncover a relationship between descendants of these two lineages, in which epiblast cells differentiate into endoderm at two distinct time points{\textemdash}before and during gastrulation. Trajectories of endoderm cells were mapped as they acquired embryonic versus extra-embryonic fates and as they spatially converged within the nascent gut endoderm, which revealed these cells to be globally similar but retain aspects of their lineage history. We observed the regionalized identity of cells along the anterior{\textendash}posterior axis of the emergent gut tube, which reflects their embryonic or extra-embryonic origin, and the coordinated patterning of these cells into organ-specific territories.},

Despite the increasing use of particle methods driven by improved computing performance, the relation between these algorithms remains formally unclear, and a unifying formal definition of particle methods is lacking. Here, we present a rigorous mathematical definition to determine particle methods and demonstrate its importance by applying it to various canonical and non-canonical algorithms, using it to prove a theorem about multi-core parallelizability, and designing a principled scientific computing software based on it. We anticipate that our formal definition will facilitate the solution of complex computational problems and the implementation of understandable and maintainable software frameworks for computer simulation.},

However, there has been a debate about its possible inconsistencies in the context of compressible viscous flow modelling. Alternative models have been put forward that, in particular, feature the density diffusive term in the equation of mass conservation. We briefly revisit physical arguments of that debate and recall a proposal of an alternative flow model, formulated by M. Sva{\textasciidieresis}rd (2018), resulting in a purely parabolic type of the governing equation system. We present some discussion of the Sva{\textasciidieresis}rd model and an overview of its numerical aspects. We also recall our recent simplification of the model to handle low Mach number isothermal flows in the weakly compressible approach. From the purely numerical standpoint, the presence of mass diffusion in the continuity equation is beneficial as it reduces dispersive errors of simple centred discretisation schemes (numerical diffusion free). This has been confirmed in the benchmark simulations, including a doubly-periodic shear layer at low Mach numbers. The results have demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency of the mass diffusive flow model that has proven well suited for effective parallelisation.},

We introduce Dynamic Constrained Grid (DCGrid), a hierarchical and adaptive grid structure for fluid simulation combined with a scheme for effectively managing the grid adaptations. DCGrid is designed to be implemented on the GPU and used in high-performance simulations. Specifically, it allows us to efficiently vary and adjust the grid resolution across the spatial domain and to rapidly evaluate local stencils and individual cells in a GPU implementation. A special feature of DCGrid is that the control of the grid adaption is modeled as an optimization under a constraint on the maximum available memory, which addresses the memory limitations in GPU-based simulation. To further advance the use of DCGrid in high-performance simulations, we complement DCGrid with an efficient scheme for approximating collisions between fluids and static solids on cells with different resolutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DCGrid for smoke flows and complex cloud simulations in which terrain-atmosphere interaction requires working with cells of varying resolution and rapidly changing conditions. Finally, we compare the performance of DCGrid to that of alternative adaptive grid structures.},

A numerical wave generator tank, which can generate desired irregular waves is modeled by the SPH method. The fluid motion is governed by continuity and Navier-Stokes equations where Weakly Compressible SPH (WCSPH) approximation is employed for the numerical discretization of the problem domain. To generate the irregular wave spectrum, a flap-type wave generator is adopted into the computational domain which yields to the modeling of moving boundary conditions on the problem domain. As benchmark studies, JONSWAP and Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrums are simulated to validate the obtained wave characteristics with the theoretical results. The performances of the wave maker are tested under different peak wave frequency values. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis is conducted to scrutinize the distribution of wave energy spectrum in the frequency domain. In the light of sufficiently long-term simulation results, it can be said that a good agreement is obtained between the numerical and theoretical results, which indicates that the presented SPH scheme can be utilized in further free-surface hydrodynamics studies related to the irregular wave regimes.},

Previous approaches of locally adaptive time steps have shown promising results in the form of increased time steps, however, they need to synchronize time steps in recurring intervals, which involves either interpolation operations or matching time steps. With our method, time steps are asynchronous through the whole simulation and no global time barriers are needed. In addition, we present an efficient method for parallelization of our novel asynchronous time integration. For both serial and parallel execution, we achieve speedups of up to 7.5 compared to fixed time steps and are able to outperform previous adaptive approaches considerably.},

These include differences in utilized registers per thread, compiler optimizations, and mappings of CUDA library calls to oneAPI equivalents. After addressing those challenges, we tested both the PAGANI and m-Cubes integrators on numerous integrands of various characteristics. To evaluate the quality of the ports, we collected performance metrics of the CUDA and oneAPI implementations on the Nvidia V100 GPU. We found that the oneAPI ports often achieve comparable performance to the CUDA versions, and that they are at most 10\% slower.},

A computer program based on this theory and with accurate close-fit section representation has been developed. Comparisons between computed values and experimental data show satisfactory agreement in general. In particular, very good agreement is shown for the heave and pitch motions and the vertical loads. Accurate results are also obtained for the coupled sway-roll motions in beam waves. Although comparisons are not yet available for the sway-roll-yaw motions in oblique waves, the satisfactory agreement shown for the horizontal loads in oblique waves suggests that the theory may also predict the horizontal motions quite well.}

The results reveal a strong linear relationship between model results and observed measurements. This indicates that the wave model dissipation is an accurate estimate of total whitecap fraction. The study also reveals that the dissipation source term is more closely related to WFA than WFT, which includes the additional contribution from maturing (stage B) whitecaps.},

Our results feature high-resolution spatial details, interactions with complex boundaries, and large open ocean domains. Our method compares favorably with previous work as well as known analytical solutions. We also present comparisons between our method and real world examples.},

  abstract = {The research on free surface flow is of great interest in fluid mechanics, with the primary task being the tracking and description of the motion of free surfaces. The development of numerical simulation techniques has led to the application of new methods in the study of free surface flow problems. One such method is the Neural Particle Method (NPM), a meshless approach for solving incompressible free surface flow. This method is built on a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which allows for training and solving based solely on initial and boundary conditions. Although the NPM is effective in dealing with free surface flow problems, it faces challenges in simulating more complex scenarios due to the lack of additional surface recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose an improved Neural Particle Method (INPM) to better simulate complex free surface flow. Our approach involves incorporating alpha-shape technology to track and recognize the fluid boundary, with boundary conditions updated constantly during operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through three numerical examples with different boundary conditions. The result shows that: (1) the addition of a surface recognition module allows for the accurate tracking and recognition of the fluid boundary, enabling more precise imposition of boundary conditions in complex situations; (2) INPM can accurately identify the surface and calculate even when particles are unevenly distributed. Compared with traditional meshless methods, INPM offers a better solution for dealing with complex free surface flow problems that involve random particle distribution. Our proposed method can improve the accuracy and stability of numerical simulations for free surface flow problems.},

In this study, the pressure field is obtained by solving a pressure Poisson equation that is derived from a two-step prediction{\textendash}correction approach applied for temporal discretization of the governing equations of fluid flows and enforcement of incompressibility. A newly developed gradient model in the context of the mesh-less moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method is applied to improve the standard gradient and Laplacian models of I-SPH method in the proposed approach. The higher accuracy of the modified SPH scheme, which is a kernel gradient-free model, in comparison with the standard I-SPH method is validated trough solving the classic benchmark problems including the dam break flow, solitary wave propagation, standing wave motion, liquid sloshing and water drop stretching.},

Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

The particle discretization offers the benefits that it simplifies the use of sparsely filled domains and arbitrary boundary geometry. Our solver can handle terrain slopes and supports two-way coupling of the particle-based height field with rigid objects. An improved surface definition is presented that reduces visible bumps related to the underlying particle representation. It furthermore smoothes areas with separating particles to achieve better rendering results.

The subset can be arbitrarily defined and also dynamically change over time to capture complex flows and small-scale surface details. The low- and high-resolution simulations are coupled by including feedback forces and defining appropriate boundary conditions. Our method offers the benefit that particles are of the same size within each simulation level. This avoids particle splitting and merging processes, and allows the simulation of very large resolution differences without any stability problems. The model is easy to implement, and we show how it can be integrated into a standard SPH simulation as well as into the incompressible PCISPH solver. Compared to the single-resolution simulation, our method produces similar surface details while improving the efficiency linearly to the achieved reduction rate of the particle number.},

Simulation of such events in a laboratory is quite laborious. Even for the preparation of the driving signals for the wave boards, one needs to resort to numerical models. In order to achieve this task, the two-dimensional time domain nonlinear problem has received considerable attention in recent years, in which a mixed Eulerian and Lagrangian method (MEL) is being used. Most of the conventional methods need the free surface to be smoothed or regridded at a particular/every time step of the simulation due to Lagrangian characteristics of motion even for a short time. This would cause numerical diffusion of energy in the system after a long time. In order to minimize this effect, the present study aims at fitting the free surface using a cubic spline approximation with a finite element approach for discretizing the domain. By doing so, the requirement of smoothing/regridding becomes a minimum. The efficiency of the present simulation procedure is shown for the standing wave problem. The application of this method to the problem of sloshing and wave interaction with a submerged obstacle has been carried out.},

  abstract = {Building animation tools for fluid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a fast time-domain boundary element method (TDBEM) to solve three-dimensional transient electromagnetic scattering problems regarding perfectly electric conductors in the classical marching-on-in-time manner. The algorithm of the fast TDBEM is a time-domain variant of the interpolation-based fast multipole method (IFMM), which is similar to the time-domain IFMM for acoustic scattering problems investigated in the author's previous studies. The principle of the present IFMM is to interpolate the kernel functions of the electric and magnetic field integral equations (EFIE and MFIE, respectively) so that every kernel function is expressed in a form of separation of variables in terms of both the spatial and temporal variables. Such an expression enables to construct a fast method to evaluate the scalar and vector potentials in the EFIE and MFIE with using so-called multipole-moments and local-coefficients associated with a space-time hierarchy. As opposed to \$O(N\_s\^2 N\_t)\$ of the conventional TDBEM, the computational complexity of the fast TDBEM is estimated as \$O(N\_s\^\{1+{\textbackslash}delta\}N\_t)\$, where \$N\_s\$ and \$N\_t\$ stand for the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, respectively, and \${\textbackslash}delta\$ is typically \$1/2\$ or \$1/3\$. The numerical examples presented the advantages of the proposed fast TDBEM over the conventional TDBEM when solving large-scale problems.},

There is still no existing method that allows one to simply describe an agitated surface of any size that is visually sufficiently realistic, without using entirely physical models that are usually very complex. We present a simple method to represent and animate an ocean surface in deep water by considering it as a procedural texture. This texture is defined by a combination of two levels of detail. The first one is a superposition of 2D trochoids whose parameters are determined by ocean wave characteristics infrequency domain. In order to increase the visual complexity of this model and to reduce computation, we incorporate a 3D turbulence function to provide a second level of detail. This turbulence function is also determined by frequency characteristics of ocean waves. Since our synthesized ocean waves spectrum approaches a real ocean waves spectrum, we obtain realistic water waves in the spatial domain. The animation of our model is performed by shifting the phase of the trochoids and by moving into the 3D turbulence function. Since our definition is procedural and continuous, it permits us to obtain any size of water surface with any level of detail as well as a simple, direct, antialiasing method. Our model can be used to generate ocean waves using 2D textures or bump maps as well as 3D textures.},

The algorithm uses a wiid wave power spectrum and generates an initial ocean wave surface via a Monte Carlo method. The linear wave dispersion relation is used to produce time sequences of ocean surfaces from the initial surface. Each of these surfaces is composed of facets that are defined by the numerical procedure. By treating each of the 'facets as a roughened surface, glitter radiance fields are generated. The reflectivity of each of the facets is a functional of the source and viewing angles, with roughness as an additional parameter. The wave height acceleration fields are also calculated from each of the ocean surfaces. A downwardacceleration threshold is used to determine whether a particular facet contains whitecaps and to determine the mean reflectivity. Thus whitecap radiance fields coherent with the glitter field are generated. The two radiance fields are then combined to generate simulated whitecap/glitter radiance fields which are compared to field data and results of these comparisons are presented.},

Large-scale, real-time ocean simulations are the biggest challenge to the authenticity of the visual system of CBATS and are also currently the main research hotspot in the field of computer graphics. In this paper, a hybrid Ocean Modeling Method based on wavelet transform is presented. This method introduces an accurate phase calculation and a wind-field model solution to compensate for the randomness of wave generation and the lack of physical mechanism in spectral methods. The computational cost is greatly reduced by using a rough spatial grid to calculate the amplitude and phase values at any point in space, which effectively avoids Nyquist{\textendash}Shannon Theorem limitations caused by the numerical solutions of PDEs (partial differential equations), and a high-fidelity simulation of high frequency, detailed sea surface and coherent phase-dependent wave effects is achieved. Practical verification shows that the method can fully meet the real-time simulation training requirements of CBATS with a strong real-time performance and good stability. Thus, it could play a significant role in improving the performance of the visual system.},

  abstract = {The error of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) using kernel for particle-based approximation mainly comes from smoothing and integration errors. The choice of kernels has a significant impact on the numerical accuracy, stability and computational efficiency. At present, the most popular kernels such as B-spline, truncated Gaussian (for compact support), Wendland kernels have 2nd-order smoothing error and Wendland kernel becomes mainstream in SPH community as its stability and accuracy. Due to the fact that the particle distribution after relaxation can achieve fast convergence of integration error respected to support radius, it is logical to choose kernels with higher-order smoothing error to improve the numerical accuracy. In this paper, the error of 4th-order Laguerre-Wendland kernel proposed by Litvinov et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{litvinov2015towards\} is revisited and another 4th-order truncated Laguerre-Gauss kernel is further analyzed and considered to replace the widely used Wendland kernel. The proposed kernel has following three properties: One is that it avoids the pair-instability problem during the relaxation process, unlike the original truncated Gaussian kernel, and achieves much less relaxation residue than Wendland and Laguerre-Wendland kernels; One is the truncated compact support size is the same as the non-truncated compact support of Wendland kernel, which leads to both kernels' computational efficiency at the same level; Another is that the truncation error of this kernel is much less than that of Wendland kernel. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of \$2D\$ and \$3D\$ benchmark cases on Eulerian SPH for fluid dynamics and total Lagrangian SPH for solid dynamics validate the considerably improved numerical accuracy by using truncated Laguerre-Gauss kernel without introducing extra computational effort.},

  abstract = {This new method for calculating wave forces on offshore structures is based on an extension of Airy theory for two-dimensional waves and uses a linear filtering technique to calculate wave forces as a function of time for wave profiles of arbitrary shape and length.Interest in wave-force predictions has been increasing in recent years with the increasing worldwide investment in offshore operations and the movement into deeper water. The larger structures required in deeper water increase the need for rapid and accurate waveforce predictions. This paper presents a method for computing wave forces from an ocean-wave profile by a linear filtering technique and compares these computed forces with measurements. The linear filter employed is developed from a modification of small-amplitude wave theory suggested by wave-tank studies and used to calculate water velocities and accelerations. In the linear filtering method, a wave train of any length and any degree of irregularity can be used in design and dynamic studies of offshore structures. Further, the change of the wave profile shape with time (dispersion) can be allowed for. Velocities and accelerations calculated with the linear filter and introduced into an equation proposed by Morison et al. permits calculation of wave forces. Force coefficients required in Morison's equation were determined by fitting calculated forces to observed hurricane wave-force measurements. Consequently, the force coefficients should be used only with the calculation procedures presented in this paper; further, their application has been limited to calculation of forces on members similar in size and surface properties to the test member used to obtain the measured properties to the test member used to obtain the measured forces.The force predictions are compared with force measurements made in about 400 waves at various heights along a 44-in.-diameter piling in 99 ft of water during Hurricane Carla in 1961. The procedure gives acceptable prediction of maximum forces at all heights above bottom. Force profiles in the four largest measured waves are reproduced with reasonable fidelity, and the peak forces in these largest waves are closely reproduced. Additional force measurements made in shallow water (34 ft) are not referred to in this paper. The wave theory used is less applicable in shallow water, leading to considerable scatter in fitting results. The force measurements indicate that wave forces fall off sharply near the surface of the water. Reproduction of the actual flow regime near the wave surface requires further modification of any way theory. This additional modification is not discussed here.Procedure Used to Predict Wave Forces Procedure Used to Predict Wave Forces Force EquationThe horizontal force per foot of vertical piling length is calculated as a function of time t and height z above the ocean bottom as:(1)Eq. 1, proposed by Morison et al., represents the total force as a sum of drag and inertial forces.JPTP. 359},

Due to the improved estimation of the initial support radius, our algorithm is able to efficiently calculate neighborhoods in a single iteration in almost any situation. We compare our neighbor list algorithm to previous approaches and show that our proposed approach can handle larger particle numbers on a single GPU due to its strict guarantees and is able to simulate more particles in real time due to its benefits in regard to performance. Additionally we demonstrate the versatility and stability of our approach in several different scenarios, for example multi-scale simulations and with different kernel functions.},

  abstract = {Combinations of waves and currents exist in a wide range of marine environments. The resulting, often complex, combined wave-current conditions largely determine the loading, response and survivability of vessels, offshore platforms and systems. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has becoming increasingly popular for free-surface flow problems which do not require special treatment to detect the free surface. The present work implements open boundaries for wave-current conditions within the SPH-based DualSPHysics solver. Open boundaries are applied for the generation of wave-alone, current-alone and combined wave-current conditions. A modified damping zone acting on the vertical velocity component is used for wave absorption and combined with open boundaries to allow particles to leave or enter the fluid domain when a current exists. Results of wave-alone (regular, irregular and focused) and current-alone (uniform, linearly sheared and arbitrary sheared) test cases demonstrate a general numerical flume is achieved. Tests of focused waves interacting with arbitrary sheared currents are validated with analytical linear solutions for surface elevation and velocities, demonstrating excellent agreement. The numerical flume may be extended to steep waves well suited to SPH and thus enable modelling complex and extreme wave-current conditions interacting with offshore platforms and systems.},

  abstract = {This dissertation describes the wave particles technique for simulating water surface waves and two way fluid-object interactions for real-time applications, such as video games. Water exists in various different forms in our environment and it is important to develop necessary technologies to be able to incorporate all these forms in real-time virtual environments. Handling the behavior of large bodies of water, such as an ocean, lake, or pool, has been computationally expensive with traditional techniques even for offline graphics applications, because of the high resolution requirements of these simulations. A significant portion of water behavior for large bodies of water is the surface wave phenomenon. This dissertation discusses how water surface waves can be simulated efficiently and effectively at real-time frame rates using a simple particle system that we call "wave particles." This approach offers a simple, fast, and unconditionally stable solution to wave simulation. Unlike traditional techniques that try to simulate the water body (or its surface) as a whole with numerical techniques, wave particles merely track the deviations of the surface due to waves forming an analytical solution. This allows simulation of seemingly infinite water surfaces, like an open ocean. Both the theory and implementation of wave particles are discussed in great detail. Two-way interactions of floating objects with water is explained, including generation of waves due to object interaction and proper simulation of the effect of water on the object motion. Timing studies show that the method is scalable, allowing simulation of wave interaction with several hundreds of objects at real-time rates.},

  abstract = {WiFi can provide network coverage for users on land at anytime and anywhere, but on the sea, the wireless communication scenes change dramatically due to the signals are non-existence. Although some techniques (e.g. satellite, undersea fiber, microwave communication) have been used in marine communication, they are either too expensive with very small bandwidth, or too limited in its coverage range. We propose to develop a marine wireless mesh network which is formed by low cost buoyed wireless base stations to provide broadband connectivity for users on the sea.},

  abstract = {Realistic simulation of natural scene has always been a hot and difficult problem in the field of computer graphics, the simulation of dynamic fluid is particularly prominent. Ocean is a representative, it plays a key role in the field of virtual reality. In the research of ocean simulation based on physics, the details are not enough and the fluid-solid interaction authenticity is poor. Therefore, the fluid-solid interaction simulation of ocean simulation is important. In this paper, we propose a fluid-solid simulation method, a two-way interaction simulation between solid model and fluid particles based on control points. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) algorithm based fluid simulation is realized and B-spline function is chosen as the kernel function through the comparative analysis of Gauss kernel function, B-spline kernel function and Quintic spline kernel function. In view of the low efficiency in the process of the fluid surface reconstruction problem, we put forward a method to limit the extraction process on the surface of the fluid. We improve the boundary movement and add some random parameter values based on the direct rebound method, cut speed in a certain degree and implement a more realistic boundary movement effect. Experiment results show the simulation effects of this method.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes the first free-stream boundary condition in a purely Lagrangian framework for weakly-compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH). The boundary condition is implemented based on several numerical techniques, including a spatio-temporal method and an ensuring technique for surface particle identification, far-field corrections of density and velocity near the free-stream boundary, and improved in- and outlet conditions which guarantee smooth inflow profile and free outflow particles without the issue of the truncated kernel. The accuracy and effectiveness of the method have been validated by the reference solutions of flow past a flat plate and circular cylinder, respectively. The method has also been tested with more complex flows to demonstrate its applicability, such as fluid-structure interaction (FSI) and 3D flow past a sphere.},

  abstract = {In this paper, based on weakly compressible smoothed particles hydrodynamics (WCSPH), we present a method for simulating high quality fluid. We propose a new pressure equation to reduce time overhead, speed up convergence towards small density fluctuations and allow for a larger time step than that of traditional approaches. And based on the new equation, we introduce a new adaptive time-stepping approach that automatically adapts the time step according to each particle current individual time step, thus improving the efficiency of computation and contributing much to a real-time particle fluid simulation. For real-time simulation, we make full use of CPU and GPU in a combined way to build a parallel platform, namely Multi-GPU platform. And optimization of the platform design is made to run a simulation with realistic visual effects in real time.},

  abstract = {A physically-based computational model, which implements a variety of technologies to real-time simulation of the ocean surface dynamics and waves-body interaction, is proposed. The method uses data from experimental observation of the real ocean, stochastic description of irregular wind waves, inverse non-uniform fast Fourier transform mathematical tool, unstructured grid representation for changeable water surface and complex geometry of the floating object, reasonably full and accurate immersed rigid-body dynamics, fast and stable algorithms for solving the equations of motion. The integrated mathematical model combines the proven approaches, which are adapted and modified for stated goals. The developed approach does not impose restrictions on complexity of the immersed body configuration. The implemented algorithms allow to perform an interactive simulation on a desktop computer using high resolution surface meshes without loss of frame rate. Some examples are considered to demonstrate the abilities of the model to simulate the interaction of partially submerged body (rescue boat) with wind-generated irregular fluctuations of the water surface in the real-time mode.},
