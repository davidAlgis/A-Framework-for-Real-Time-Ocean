Allowing the water to interact with rigid bodies is essential for applications such as games, but traditional heightfield interaction methods concentrate on water-to-body effects by letting water flow through the bodies. We instead take an approach where the bodies block water. Our earlier method is improved in several ways, taking steps toward a single method to create both water-to-body and body-to-water effects. The new method is also visually compared to a traditional method by Thürey et al. A drawback of our method is that it has some grid aliasing artifacts that appear especially when the method is used for floating bodies. However, our method is demonstrated to work together with the Thürey method, which allows us to get the best of both worlds to simulate both floating and blocking bodies in a single scene. The method runs in real time for large areas of water even with a very limited {GPU} budget.},

Regions of liquid that cannot be represented by the height field including breaking waves, water falls and splashing due to rigid and soft bodies interaction are automatically turned into spray, splash and foam particles. The particles are treated as simple non-interacting point masses and they exchange mass and momentum with the height field fluid. We also present a method for procedurally adding small scale waves that are advected with the water flow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various test scene including a large flowing river along a valley with beaches, big rocks, steep cliffs and waterfalls.

The most efficient {SPH}-based approaches enforce incompressibility either on position or velocity level. However, the continuity equation for incompressible flow demands to maintain a constant density and a divergence-free velocity field. We propose a combination of two novel implicit pressure solvers enforcing both a low volume compression as well as a divergence-free velocity field. While a compression-free fluid is essential for realistic physical behavior, a divergence-free velocity field drastically reduces the number of required solver iterations and increases the stability of the simulation significantly. Thanks to the improved stability, our method can handle larger time steps than previous approaches. This results in a substantial performance gain since the computationally expensive neighborhood search has to be performed less frequently. Moreover, we introduce a third optional implicit solver to simulate highly viscous fluids which seamlessly integrates into our solver framework. Our implicit viscosity solver produces realistic results while introducing almost no numerical damping. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness and scalability of our method in a variety of complex simulations including scenarios with millions of turbulent particles or highly viscous materials.},

With this survey, we offer an overview of the developments and still‐active research on physics simulation methodologies based on {SPH} that has not been addressed in previous {SPH} surveys. Following an introduction about typical {SPH} discretization techniques, we provide an overview over the most used incompressibility solvers and present novel insights regarding their relation and conditional equivalence. The survey further covers recent advances in implicit and particle‐based boundary handling and sampling techniques. While {SPH} is best known in the context of fluid simulation we discuss modern concepts to augment the range of simulatable physical characteristics including turbulence, highly viscous matter, deformable solids, as well as rigid body contact handling. Besides the purely numerical approaches, simulation techniques aided by machine learning are on the rise. Thus, the survey discusses recent data‐driven approaches and the impact of differentiable solvers on artist control.

Additionally, we introduce a novel, normalized parameter called "swell" which modifies the directional spreading to produce wavelength-dependent elongation of waves into parallel wave trains. This paper builds upon the spectral ocean synthesis techniques popularized for computer graphics in Jerry Tessendorf's popular {SIGGRAPH} Course, "Simulating Ocean Water" and the accompanying course notes. The advancement of our spectra over the spectrum described by Tessendorf is that it readily gives plausible, attractive results for a wide range of wind speeds, ocean depths, and other physical parameters, without requiring artists to manually adjust gain and filter parameters to compensate for model inaccuracies. Our "swell" parameter additionally provides an intuitive interface for smoothly varying between choppy seas due to local storms and swells from distant weather events.},

	abstract = {The vertical motions and wave induced loads on ships with forward speed are studied in the time domain, considering non-linear effects associated with large amplitude motions and hull flare shape. The method is based on a strip theory, using singularities distributed on the cross sections which satisfy the linear free surface condition. The solution is obtained in the time domain using convolution to account for the memory effects related to the free surface oscillations. In this way the linear radiation forces are represented in terms of impulse response functions, infinite frequency added masses and radiation restoring coefficients. The diffraction forces associated with incident wave scattering are linear. The hydrostatic and Froude-Krylov forces are evaluated over the instantaneous wetted surface of the hull to account for the large amplitude motions and hull flare. The radiation contribution for wave loads is also obtained in the time domain using convolution to account for the memory effects related to the free surface oscillations. Results of motions and wave loads for the S175 container ship are presented and analyzed. The results from the present method are compared with linear results.},

	url = {http://www.cemyuksel.com/research/waveparticles/cem_yuksel_dissertation.pdf},
	abstract = {This dissertation describes the wave particles technique for simulating water surface waves and two way fluid-object interactions for real-time applications, such as video games. Water exists in various different forms in our environment and it is important to develop necessary technologies to be able to incorporate all these forms in real-time virtual environments. Handling the behavior of large bodies of water, such as an ocean, lake, or pool, has been computationally expensive with traditional techniques even for offline graphics applications, because of the high resolution requirements of these simulations. A significant portion of water behavior for large bodies of water is the surface wave phenomenon. This dissertation discusses how water surface waves can be simulated efficiently and effectively at real-time frame rates using a simple particle system that we call "wave particles." This approach offers a simple, fast, and unconditionally stable solution to wave simulation. Unlike traditional techniques that try to simulate the water body (or its surface) as a whole with numerical techniques, wave particles merely track the deviations of the surface due to waves forming an analytical solution. This allows simulation of seemingly infinite water surfaces, like an open ocean. Both the theory and implementation of wave particles are discussed in great detail. Two-way interactions of floating objects with water is explained, including generation of waves due to object interaction and proper simulation of the effect of water on the object motion. Timing studies show that the method is scalable, allowing simulation of wave interaction with several hundreds of objects at real-time rates.},

A computer program based on this theory and with accurate close-fit section representation has been developed. Comparisons between computed values and experimental data show satisfactory agreement in general. In particular, very good agreement is shown for the heave and pitch motions and the vertical loads. Accurate results are also obtained for the coupled sway-roll motions in beam waves. Although comparisons are not yet available for the sway-roll-yaw motions in oblique waves, the satisfactory agreement shown for the horizontal loads in oblique waves suggests that the theory may also predict the horizontal motions quite well.},

	abstract = {We present a strong fluid-rigid coupling for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) fluids and rigid bodies with particle-sampled surfaces. The approach interlinks the iterative pressure update at fluid particles with a second {SPH} solver that computes artificial pressure at rigid-body particles. The introduced {SPH} rigid-body solver models rigid-rigid contacts as artificial density deviations at rigid-body particles. The corresponding pressure is iteratively computed by solving a global formulation that is particularly useful for large numbers of rigid-rigid contacts. Compared to previous {SPH} coupling methods, the proposed concept stabilizes the fluid-rigid interface handling. It significantly reduces the computation times of {SPH} fluid simulations by enabling larger time steps. Performance gain factors of up to 58 compared to previous methods are presented. We illustrate the flexibility of the presented fluid-rigid coupling by integrating it into {DFSPH}, {IISPH}, and a recent {SPH} solver for highly viscous fluids. We further show its applicability to a recent {SPH} solver for elastic objects. Large scenarios with up to 90M particles of various interacting materials and complex contact geometries with up to 90k rigid-rigid contacts are shown. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed rigid-body solver by comparing it to Bullet.},

The problem of inhomogeneous boundary sampling is addressed by considering the relative contribution of a boundary particle to a physical quantity. This facilitates not only the initialization process but also allows the simulation of multiple dynamic objects. Thin structures consisting of only one layer or one line of boundary particles, and also non-manifold geometries can be handled without any additional treatment.

	abstract = {Equilibrium spectral behavior for ocean gravity wind waves has been investigated actively over the past three decades, yet fundamental problems remain in reconciling theory with observations. Predicted equilibrium spectral forms from physical models proposed recently by Kitaigorodskii and by Phillips are examined in the light of wavenumber and frequency spectra reported by several investigators. While frequency domain observations appear to support the model predictions, observed wavenumber spectra are found to differ both in the spectral dependence on wavenumber and on the wind speed.

Based on observed wavenumber and frequency spectra for fetch-limited condition a model is proposed for the form of the directional wavenumber spectrum slice in the dominant wave direction. Reduced wavenumber and frequency spectra are calculated from this model, assuming an empirical spectral directional spreading function and the linear gravity wave dispersion relation. These calculations reveal the underlying influences which shape these reduced spectra. In the energy containing subrange, just above the spectral peak, the dominant influence shaping these spectra is the variation of the directional spreading function with distance from the spectral peak. For frequency spectra, at higher frequencies, the model calculations predict that the range of observed frequency spectral dependences is due primarily to the Doppler shifting from advection of the shorter waves by the orbital motion of the dominant waves, with possible additional influences of wind drift and ambient currents.

Combining these results, composite calculated frequency spectra and one-dimensional wavenumber spectra show close correspondence with measured field spectra. In addition to clarifying the key processes that shape different regimes in the frequency spectrum, a refinement of the bounds of the gravity equilibrium subrange is proposed.},

With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible {SPH} ({PCISPH}) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible {SPH} ({WCSPH}) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the {WCSPH} results.},
