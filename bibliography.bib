In this work we present an iterative density solver integrated into the Position Based Dynamics framework ({PBD}). By formulating and solving a set of positional constraints that enforce constant density, our method allows similar incompressibility and convergence to modern smoothed particle hydro-dynamic ({SPH}) solvers, but inherits the stability of the geometric, position based dynamics method, allowing large time steps suitable for real-time applications. We incorporate an artificial pressure term that improves particle distribution, creates surface tension, and lowers the neighborhood requirements of traditional {SPH}. Finally, we address the issue of energy loss by applying vorticity confinement as a velocity post process.},

Similar to the mode-splitting method (used e.g. in oceanography), we separate the simulation of the low-frequency liquid flow and the high-frequency free surface waves. Hence, the performance for highly detailed liquid simulations can be increased immensely. Thereby, we use the 2D wave equation for surface simulation and the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for describing the liquid flow. Thus, the surface as well as the liquid flow are simulated physically-based, resulting in highly detailed and fully interactive liquid simulations: The liquid flows according to gravity, ground, obstacles and interactions, and the surface interacts with impacts, moving obstacles or simulates the propagation of highly detailed surface waves. Our method obtains realistic results at high framerates. Therefore, it is very suitable for today's video games, {VR}-Environments or medical simulators.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the novel concept of density maps for robust handling of static and rigid dynamic boundaries in fluid simulations based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}). In contrast to the vast majority of existing approaches, we use an implicit discretization for a continuous extension of the density field throughout solid boundaries. Using the novel representation we enhance accuracy and efficiency of density and density gradient evaluations in boundary regions by computationally efficient lookups into our density maps. The map is generated in a preprocessing step and discretizes the density contribution in the boundary's near-field. In consequence of the high regularity of the continuous boundary density field, we use cubic Lagrange polynomials on a narrow-band structure of a regular grid for discretization. This strategy not only removes the necessity to sample boundary surfaces with particles but also decouples the particle size from the number of sample points required to represent the boundary. Moreover, it solves the ever-present problem of particle deficiencies near the boundary. In several comparisons we show that the representation is more accurate than particle samplings, especially for smooth curved boundaries. We further demonstrate that our approach robustly handles scenarios with highly complex boundaries and even outperforms one of the most recent sampling based techniques.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a novel method to predict pressure values at boundary particles in incompressible divergence-free {SPH} simulations ({DFSPH}). Our approach employs Moving Least Squares ({MLS}) to predict the pressure at boundary particles. Therefore, {MLS} computes hyperplanes that approximate the pressure field at the interface between fluid and boundary particles. We compare this approach with three previous techniques. One previous technique mirrors the pressure from fluid to boundary particles. Another one extrapolates the pressure from fluid to boundary particles, but uses a gradient that is computed with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}). The third one solves a pressure Poisson equation ({PPE}) for boundary particles. In our experiments, we indicate artifacts in the three previous approaches. We show that these artifacts are significantly reduced with our approach resulting in simulation steps that can be twice as large. We motivate that gradient-based extrapolation is more accurate than mirroring. We further motivate that, due to particle deficiency at the boundary, the {SPH} gradient is error prone. This is less the case for our proposed {MLS} gradient. Moreover, our approach is computationally less expensive as solving a {PPE} for the boundary particles. We present challenging and complex scenarios to illustrate the capabilities of our method. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed boundary handling is applicable to highly viscous fluids.},

Allowing the water to interact with rigid bodies is essential for applications such as games, but traditional heightfield interaction methods concentrate on water-to-body effects by letting water flow through the bodies. We instead take an approach where the bodies block water. Our earlier method is improved in several ways, taking steps toward a single method to create both water-to-body and body-to-water effects. The new method is also visually compared to a traditional method by Thürey et al. A drawback of our method is that it has some grid aliasing artifacts that appear especially when the method is used for floating bodies. However, our method is demonstrated to work together with the Thürey method, which allows us to get the best of both worlds to simulate both floating and blocking bodies in a single scene. The method runs in real time for large areas of water even with a very limited {GPU} budget.},

The tests were dedicated to providing a rigorous benchmark dataset for numerical model validation. The sphere was ballasted to half submergence, thereby floating with the waterline at the equator when at rest in calm water. Heave decay tests were conducted, wherein the sphere was held stationary and dropped from three drop heights: a small drop height, which can be considered a linear case, a moderately nonlinear case, and a highly nonlinear case with a drop height from a position where the whole sphere was initially above the water. The precision of the heave decay time series was calculated from random and systematic standard uncertainties. At a 95\% confidence level, uncertainties were found to be very low—on average only about 0.3\% of the respective drop heights. Physical parameters of the test setup and associated uncertainties were quantified. A test case was formulated that closely represents the physical tests, enabling the reader to do his/her own numerical tests. The paper includes a comparison of the physical test results to the results from several independent numerical models based on linear potential flow, fully nonlinear potential flow, and the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes ({RANS}) equations. A high correlation between physical and numerical test results is shown. The physical test results are very suitable for numerical model validation and are public as a benchmark dataset.},

Additionally, we present a fast, particle-based boat simulation, which is coupled to water simulation. Importantly, most parts of our method can be implemented efficiently on {GPUs}. We demonstrate the visual realism and performance of our approach with several experiments using different boats and other floating objects, achieving high frame rates on a desktop {PC}.},

Our specialized shallow water solver can handle arbitrary underlying terrain slopes, arbitrary water depth and supports wet-dry regions tracking. To treat open water scenes we introduce a method for handling non-reflecting boundary conditions. Regions of liquid that cannot be represented by the height field including breaking waves, water falls and splashing due to rigid and soft bodies interaction are automatically turned into spray, splash and foam particles. The particles are treated as simple non-interacting point masses and they exchange mass and momentum with the height field fluid. We also present a method for procedurally adding small scale waves that are advected with the water flow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various test scene including a large flowing river along a valley with beaches, big rocks, steep cliffs and waterfalls. Both the grid and the particles simulations are implemented in {CUDA}. We achieve real-time performance on modern {GPUs} in all the examples.},

We introduce Dynamic Constrained Grid ({DCGrid}), a hierarchical and adaptive grid structure for fluid simulation combined with a scheme for effectively managing the grid adaptations. {DCGrid} is designed to be implemented on the {GPU} and used in high-performance simulations. Specifically, it allows us to efficiently vary and adjust the grid resolution across the spatial domain and to rapidly evaluate local stencils and individual cells in a {GPU} implementation. A special feature of {DCGrid} is that the control of the grid adaption is modeled as an optimization under a constraint on the maximum available memory, which addresses the memory limitations in {GPU}-based simulation. To further advance the use of {DCGrid} in high-performance simulations, we complement {DCGrid} with an efficient scheme for approximating collisions between fluids and static solids on cells with different resolutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {DCGrid} for smoke flows and complex cloud simulations in which terrain-atmosphere interaction requires working with cells of varying resolution and rapidly changing conditions. Finally, we compare the performance of {DCGrid} to that of alternative adaptive grid structures.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06105},
	abstract = {Thanks to the computational power of modern cluster machines, numerical simulations can provide, with an unprecedented level of details, new insights into ﬂuid mechanics. However, taking full advantage of this hardware remains challenging since data communication remains a signiﬁcant bottleneck to reaching peak performances. Reducing ﬂoating point precision is a simple and eﬀective way to reduce data movement and improve the computational speed of most applications. Nevertheless, special care needs to be taken to ensure the quality and convergence of computed solutions, especially when dealing with complex ﬂuid simulations. In this work, we analyse the impact of reduced (single and mixed compared to double) precision on computational performance and accuracy for computational ﬂuid dynamics. Using the open source library {OpenFOAM}, we consider incompressible, compressible, and multiphase ﬂuid solvers for testing on relevant benchmarks for ﬂows in the laminar and turbulent regime and in the presence of shock waves. Computational gain and changes in the scalability of applications in reduced precision are also discussed. In particular, an ad hoc theoretical model for the strong scaling allows us to interpret and understand the observed behaviors, as a function of ﬂoating point precision and hardware speciﬁcs. Finally, we show how reduced precision can signiﬁcantly speed up a hybrid {CPU}-{GPU} implementation, made available to {OpenFOAM} end-users recently, that simply relies on a {GPU} linear algebra solver developed by hardware vendors.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method for the efficient and stable simulation of incompressible fluids. The most efficient {SPH}-based approaches enforce incompressibility either on position or velocity level. However, the continuity equation for incompressible flow demands to maintain a constant density and a divergence-free velocity field. We propose a combination of two novel implicit pressure solvers enforcing both a low volume compression as well as a divergence-free velocity field. While a compression-free fluid is essential for realistic physical behavior, a divergence-free velocity field drastically reduces the number of required solver iterations and increases the stability of the simulation significantly. Thanks to the improved stability, our method can handle larger time steps than previous approaches. This results in a substantial performance gain since the computationally expensive neighborhood search has to be performed less frequently. Moreover, we introduce a third optional implicit solver to simulate highly viscous fluids which seamlessly integrates into our solver framework. Our implicit viscosity solver produces realistic results while introducing almost no numerical damping. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness and scalability of our method in a variety of complex simulations including scenarios with millions of turbulent particles or highly viscous materials.},

	abstract = {The method of pre-computed smoothing kernel functions is used to accelerate the proposed {SPH} model and can effectively improve the real-time performance of the algorithm while maintaining sufficient accuracy. In this paper, a novel, incompressible fluid simulation framework based on the divergence-free Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model is presented. The novel {SPH} model combines a system of non-linear density constraint conditions and the divergence-free velocity field condition to enforce fluid incompressibility. In the new framework, the position of particles is firstly modified by solving the density constraints, and the distribution of particles is adjusted to keep the density of fluid in a relatively constant state. Then the divergence-free state increases the stability significantly and reduces the number of solver iterations. Compared to the modern Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic ({SPH}) solvers, the new {SPH} framework allows better incompressibility and similar convergence. Finally, the method of pre-computed smoothing kernel functions is used to accelerate the proposed {SPH} model. It can effectively improve the real-time performance of the algorithm while maintaining sufficient accuracy.},

Various methods have been proposed to implement the solid wall, and inlet/outlet and other boundary conditions. However, error estimation and the formal rates of convergence for these methods have not been discussed or examined carefully. In this paper, we use the method of manufactured solution ({MMS}) to verify the convergence properties of a variety of commonly employed of various solid, inlet, and outlet boundary implementations. In order to perform this study, we propose various manufactured solutions for diﬀerent domains. On the basis of the convergence oﬀered by these methods, we systematically propose a convergent {WCSPH} scheme along with suitable methods for implementing the boundary conditions. Along with other recent developments in the use of adaptive resolution, this paves the way for accurate and eﬃcient simulation of incompressible or weakly-compressible ﬂuid ﬂows using the {SPH} method.},

	abstract = {The weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({WCSPH}) method has been employed to simulate various physical phenomena involving ﬂuids and solids. Various methods have been proposed to implement the solid wall, and inlet/outlet and other boundary conditions. However, error estimation and the formal rates of convergence for these methods have not been discussed or examined carefully. In this paper, we use the method of manufactured solution ({MMS}) to verify the convergence properties of a variety of commonly employed of various solid, inlet, and outlet boundary implementations. In order to perform this study, we propose various manufactured solutions for diﬀerent domains. On the basis of the convergence oﬀered by these methods, we systematically propose a convergent {WCSPH} scheme along with suitable methods for implementing the boundary conditions. Along with other recent developments in the use of adaptive resolution, this paves the way for accurate and eﬃcient simulation of incompressible or weakly-compressible ﬂuid ﬂows using the {SPH} method.},

The investigation focuses on both the steady and unsteady one-dimensional heat conduction problems with Dirichlet boundary conditions, but this technique is applicable to multidimensional and other mathematical models. By using all the variables of the real type and quadruple precision (extended precision or Real*16) we were able to, for example, reduce the discretization error from 1.67E−08 to 3.46E−33 with four extrapolations, limited only by the round-off error and, consequently, determining benchmark solutions for the variable of interest ψ(1/2) using the {SPH} method. The increase in {CPU} time and memory usage owing to post-processing was almost null. {RRE} has proven to be robust in determining up to a sixteenth order of accuracy in meshless discretization for the spatial domain.},

Nevertheless, you should think of the information in this book as a foundation on which to build, rather than as a completed cathedral. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to help make further progress in the exciting field of parallel programming-progress that will in time render this book obsolete. Parallel programming in the 21st century is no longer focused solely on science, research, and grand-challenge projects. And this is all to the good, because it means that parallel programming is becoming an engineering discipline. Therefore, as befits an engineering discipline, this book examines specific parallel-programming tasks and describes how to approach them. In some surprisingly common cases, these tasks can be automated. This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering discipline underlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation of parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old wheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new frontiers. However, what you get from this book will be determined by what you put into it. It is hoped that simply reading this book will be helpful, and that working the Quick Quizzes will be even more helpful. However, the best results come from applying the techniques taught in this book to real-life problems. As always, practice makes perfect. But no matter how you approach it, we sincerely hope that parallel programming brings you at least as much fun, excitement, and challenge that it has brought to us!},

The accuracy and eﬀectiveness of the method have been validated by the reference solutions of ﬂow past a ﬂat plate and circular cylinder, respectively.

We propose a hierarchical graph for learning physics and a novel way to handle obstacles. The finest level of the graph consist of the particles itself. Coarser levels consist of the cells of sparse grids with successively doubling cell sizes covering the volume occupied by the particles. The hierarchical structure allows for the information to propagate at great distance in a single message passing iteration. The novel obstacle handling allows the simulation to be obstacle aware without the need for ghost particles. We train the network to predict effective acceleration produced by multiple sub-steps of 3D multi-material material point method ({MPM}) simulation consisting of water, sand and snow with complex obstacles. Our network produces lower error, trains up to 7.0X faster and inferences up to 11.3X faster than [{SGGP}∗20]. It is also, on average, about 3.7X faster compared to Taichi Elements simulation running on the same hardware in our tests.

	abstract = {We develop a linearly-scaling variant of the Force Coupling Method [K. Yeo and M. R. Maxey, J. Fluid Mech. 649, 205-231 (2010)] for computing hydrodynamic interactions among particles confined to a doubly-periodic geometry with either a single bottom wall or two walls (slit channel) in the aperiodic direction. Our spectrally-accurate Stokes solver uses the Fast Fourier Transform ({FFT}) in the periodic \$xy\$ plane and Chebyshev polynomials in the aperiodic \$z\$ direction normal to the wall(s). We decompose the problem into two subproblems. The first is a doubly-periodic system in the presence of particles (source terms) with free-space boundary conditions in the \$z\$ direction, which we solve by borrowing ideas from a recent method for rapid evaluation of electrostatic interactions in doubly-periodic geometries [O. Maxian, R. P. Pelaez, L. Greengard and A. Donev, J. Chem. Phys. 154, 204107 (2021)]. The second is a correction subproblem to impose the boundary conditions on the wall(s). Instead of the traditional Gaussian kernel, we use the exponential of a semicircle kernel to model the source terms (body force) due to the presence of particles, and provide optimum values for the kernel parameters that ensure a given hydrodynamic radius with at least two digits of accuracy and rotational and translational invariance. The computation time of our solver, which is implemented in graphical processing units, scales linearly with the number of particles, and allows computations with about a million particles in less than a second for a sedimented layer of colloidal microrollers.},

We also discuss an improved surface tension model that is particularly appropriate for single-phase free-surface ﬂows. The proposed model is compared to existing models and experiments illustrate the accuracy of the approach for free surface ﬂows. Combining the proposed methods, volume-preserving low-viscosity liquids can be efﬁciently simulated using {SPH}. The approach is appropriate for medium-scale and small-scale phenomena.

While our method focuses on maxi- mizing performance in fixed-radius {SPH} simulations, we show that it can also be used in scenarios where the particle support radius is not constant thanks to the adaptive nature of the octree acceleration structure. possible followed by direct distance comparisons between the remaining particle pairs. the of an effort to minimize the actual computation time, we find that distance com- parisons exhibit very high throughput on modern {CPUs}. By permitting more comparisons than strictly necessary, the time spent on preparing and search- ing the acceleration structure can be reduced, yielding a net positive speedup. The choice of an octree acceleration structure, instead of the uniform grid typically used in fixed-radius methods, ensures balanced computational tasks. This benefits both parallelism and provides consistently high com- putational intensity for the distance comparisons. We present a detailed account of high-level considerations that, together with low-level decisions, enable high throughput for performance-critical parts of the algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the high performance of our algorithm on a number of large-scale fixed-radius {SPH} benchmarks and show in experiments with a support radius ratio up to 3 that our method is also effective in multi-resolution {SPH} simulations.},

With our approach, we allow a dedicated time step for each particle. Therefore, we are able to increase the efficiency of simulations. Previous approaches of locally adaptive time steps have shown promising results in the form of increased time steps, however, they need to synchronize time steps in recurring intervals, which involves either interpolation operations or matching time steps. With our method, time steps are asynchronous through the whole simulation and no global time barriers are needed. In addition, we present an efficient method for parallelization of our novel asynchronous time integration. For both serial and parallel execution, we achieve speedups of up to 7.5 compared to fixed time steps and are able to outperform previous adaptive approaches considerably.},

With this survey, we offer an overview of the developments and still‐active research on physics simulation methodologies based on {SPH} that has not been addressed in previous {SPH} surveys. Following an introduction about typical {SPH} discretization techniques, we provide an overview over the most used incompressibility solvers and present novel insights regarding their relation and conditional equivalence. The survey further covers recent advances in implicit and particle‐based boundary handling and sampling techniques. While {SPH} is best known in the context of fluid simulation we discuss modern concepts to augment the range of simulatable physical characteristics including turbulence, highly viscous matter, deformable solids, as well as rigid body contact handling. Besides the purely numerical approaches, simulation techniques aided by machine learning are on the rise. Thus, the survey discusses recent data‐driven approaches and the impact of differentiable solvers on artist control. Finally, we provide context for discussion by outlining existing problems and opportunities to open up new research directions.},

At the same time, it is also useful for practicing system designers and embedded programmers. The book assumes the reader has a working knowledge of C/C++ and includes a significant amount of sample code. In addition, we assume familiarity with basic computer architecture concepts (pipelining, speedup, Amdahl's Law, etc.).

	abstract = {Parallelism is often required for performance. In these situations an excess of non-determinism is harmful as it means the program can have several different behaviours or even different results. Even in domains such as high-performance computing where parallelism is crucial for performance, the computed value should be deterministic. Unfortunately, non-determinism in programs also allows dynamic scheduling of tasks, reacting to the first task that succeeds, cancelling tasks that cannot lead to a result, etc. Non-determinism is thus both a desired asset or an undesired property depending on the situation. In practice, it is often necessary to limit non-determinism and to identify precisely the sources of non-determinism in order to control what parts of a program are deterministic or not. This survey takes the perspective of programming languages, and studies how programming models can ensure the determinism of parallel programs. This survey studies not only deterministic languages but also programming models that prevent one particularly demanding source of non-determinism: data races. Our objective is to compare existing solutions to the following questions: How programming languages can help programmers write programs that run in a parallel manner without visible non-determinism? What programming paradigms ensure this kind of properties? We study these questions and discuss the merits and limitations of different approaches.},

The two most prominent and fastest algorithms use virtual and explicitly allocated uniform grids to achieve high performance on Graphics Processing Units ({GPUs}). However, they have disadvantages with numerous particle simulation domains, either in terms of run time or memory consumption.

To model and animate the ocean’s surface, these methods mainly rely on two main approaches: on the one hand, those which approximate ocean dynamics with parametric, spectral or hybrid models and use empirical laws from oceanographic research. We will see that this type of methods essentially allows the simulation of ocean scenes in the deep water domain, without breaking waves. On the other hand, physically-based methods use Navier–Stokes equations to represent breaking waves and more generally ocean surface near the shore. We also describe ocean rendering methods in computer graphics, with a special interest in the simulation of phenomena such as foam and spray, and light’s interaction with the ocean surface.},

@book{kehlEfficientlySimulatingLagrangian2022,
	title = {Efficiently Simulating Lagrangian Particles in Large-Scale Ocean Flows – Data Structures and their Impact on Geophysical Applications},
	abstract = {Studying oceanography by using Lagrangian simulations has been adopted for a range of scenarios, such as the determining the fate of microplastics in the ocean, simulating the origin locations of microplankton used for palaeoceanographic reconstructions, for studying the impact of fish aggregation devices on the migration behaviour of tuna. These simulations are complex and represent a considerable runtime effort to obtain trajectory results, which is the prime motivation for enhancing the performance of Lagrangian particle simulators. This paper analyses and compares established performance enhancing technique from Eulerian simulators with the computational conditions and demands of Lagrangian simulators. A performance enhancement strategy specifically targeting physics-based Lagrangian particle simulations is outlined to address the performance gaps, and techniques for closing the performance gap are presented and implemented. Realistic experiments are derived from three specific oceanographic application scenarios, and the suggested performance-enhancing techniques are benchmarked in detail, so to allow for a good attribution of speed-up measurements to individual techniques. The impacts and insights from the performance enhancement strategy are further discussed for Lagrangian simulations in other geoscientific applications. The experiments show that I/O-enhancing techniques, such as dynamic loading and buffering, lead to considerable speed-up on-par with an idealised parallelisation of the process over 20 nodes. Conversely, alternative data structures to a {CPU} cache-efficient structure-of-arrays do not fulfill the theoretically-expected performance increase, which also demonstrates the importance of good cache alignment for Lagrangian physics simulations.},

The crucial particle neighborhood search is based on Z-indexing and parallel sorting which eliminates {GPU} memory overhead due to grid or hierarchical data structures. Furthermore, it overcomes limitations imposed by shading languages allowing it to be very ﬂexible and approaching the practical limits of modern graphics hardware. For visualizing the {SPH} simulation we introduce a new rendering pipeline. In the ﬁrst step, all surface particles are efﬁciently extracted from the {SPH} particle cloud exploiting the simulation data. Subsequently, a partial and therefore fast distance ﬁeld volume is rasterized from the surface particles. In the last step, the distance ﬁeld volume is directly rendered using state-of-the-art {GPU} raycasting. This rendering pipeline allows for high quality visualization at very high frame rates.},

Due to the improved estimation of the initial support radius, our algorithm is able to efﬁciently calculate neighborhoods in a single iteration in almost any situation. We compare our neighbor list algorithm to previous approaches and show that our proposed approach can handle larger particle numbers on a single {GPU} due to its strict guarantees and is able to simulate more particles in real time due to its beneﬁts in regard to performance. Additionally we demonstrate the versatility and stability of our approach in several different scenarios, for example multi-scale simulations and with different kernel functions.},

To this end, we propose an efficient {GPU} streaming pipeline to map the entire computational task onto the {GPU}, fully exploiting the massive computational power of state-of-the-art {GPUs}. In {PCISPH}-based simulations, neighbor search is the major performance obstacle because this process is performed several times at each time step. To eliminate this bottleneck, an efficient parallel sorting method for this time-consuming step is introduced. Moreover, we discuss several optimization techniques including using fast on-chip shared memory to avoid global memory bandwidth limitations and thus further improve performance on modern {GPU} hardware. With our framework, the realism of real-time fluid simulation is significantly improved since our method enforces incompressibility constraint which is typically ignored due to efficiency reason in previous {GPU}-based {SPH} methods. The performance results illustrate that our approach can efficiently simulate realistic incompressible fluid in real time and results in a speed-up factor of up to 23 on a high-end {NVIDIA} {GPU} in comparison to single-threaded {CPU}-based implementation.},

This paper presents novel and efficient strategies to spatially adapt the amount of computational effort applied based on the local dynamics of a free surface flow, for both classic weakly compressible {SPH} ({WCSPH}) and predictive-corrective incompressible {SPH} ({PCISPH}). Using a convenient and readily parallelizable block-based approach, different regions of the fluid are assigned differing time steps and solved at different rates to minimize computational cost. Our approach for {WCSPH} scheme extends an asynchronous {SPH} technique from compressible flow of astrophysical phenomena to the incompressible free surface setting, and further accelerates it by entirely decoupling the time steps of widely spaced particles. Similarly, our approach to {PCISPH} adjusts the the number of iterations of density correction applied to different regions, and asynchronously updates the neighborhood regions used to perform these corrections; this sharply reduces the computational cost of slowly deforming regions while preserving the standard density invariant. We demonstrate our approaches on a number of highly dynamic scenarios, demonstrating that they can typically double the speed of a simulation compared to standard methods while achieving visually consistent results.},

We use the Texel {MARSEN} {ARSLOE} ({TMA}) empirical model for the non-directional component of the wave spectrum, and compare a selection of empirically-based directional spreading functions. Additionally, we introduce a novel, normalized parameter called "swell" which modifies the directional spreading to produce wavelength-dependent elongation of waves into parallel wave trains. This paper builds upon the spectral ocean synthesis techniques popularized for computer graphics in Jerry Tessendorf's popular {SIGGRAPH} Course, "Simulating Ocean Water" and the accompanying course notes. The advancement of our spectra over the spectrum described by Tessendorf is that it readily gives plausible, attractive results for a wide range of wind speeds, ocean depths, and other physical parameters, without requiring artists to manually adjust gain and filter parameters to compensate for model inaccuracies. Our "swell" parameter additionally provides an intuitive interface for smoothly varying between choppy seas due to local storms and swells from distant weather events.},

The computational cost is greatly reduced by using a rough spatial grid to calculate the amplitude and phase values at any point in space, which effectively avoids Nyquist–Shannon Theorem limitations caused by the numerical solutions of {PDEs} (partial differential equations), and a high-fidelity simulation of high frequency, detailed sea surface and coherent phase-dependent wave effects is achieved. Practical verification shows that the method can fully meet the real-time simulation training requirements of {CBATS} with a strong real-time performance and good stability. Thus, it could play a significant role in improving the performance of the visual system.},

	abstract = {The simulation of large open water surface is challenging using a uniform volumetric discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Simulating water splashes near moving objects, which height field methods for water waves cannot capture, necessitates high resolutions. Such simulations can be carried out using the Fluid-Implicit-Particle ({FLIP}) method. However, the {FLIP} method is not efficient for the long-lasting water waves that propagate to long distances, which require sufficient depth for a correct dispersion relationship. This paper presents a new method to tackle this dilemma through an efficient hybridization of volumetric and surface-based advection-projection discretizations. We design a hybrid time-stepping algorithm that combines a {FLIP} domain and an adaptively remeshed Boundary Element Method ({BEM}) domain for the incompressible Euler equations. The resulting framework captures the detailed water splashes near moving objects with the {FLIP} method, and produces convincing water waves with correct dispersion relationships at modest additional costs.},

In contrast to most hybrid approaches that use particles to simulate foam and spray only, we also represent the bulk of water near the surface with both particles and a grid depending on the regions of interest and switch between those two representations during the course of the simulation. For the coupling we leverage the recent idea of tracking the water surface with a density field in grid based methods. Combining particles and a grid simulation then amounts to adding the density field of the particles and the one stored on the grid. For open scenes, we simulate the water outside of the 3D grid domain by solving the Shallow Water Equations on a height field. We propose new methods to couple these two domains such that waves travel naturally across the border. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios including a whale breaching simulation, all running in real-time or at interactive rates.},

We explain the approximations imposed by the shallow water model, and how to parametrize it according to the parameters of a 3D simulation. Each simulation is used to initialize double layered boundary conditions for the other one. The area covered by the 2D region can be an order of magnitude larger than the 3D region without signiﬁcantly effecting the overall computation time. The 3D region can furthermore be easily moved within the 2D region during the course of the simulation. To achieve realistic results we combine our simulation method with a physically based model to generate and animate drops. For their generation we make use of the ﬂuid turbulence model, and animate them with a simpliﬁed drag calculation. This allows simulations with relatively low resolutions.},

In order to better obtain photorealism in the behavior of the simulated water surface, we introduce a new “thickened” front tracking technique to accurately represent the water surface and a new velocity extrapolation method to move the surface in a smooth, water-like manner. The velocity extrapolation method allows us to provide a degree of control to the surface motion, e.g. to generate a windblown look or to force the water to settle quickly. To ensure that the photorealism of the simulation carries over to the ﬁnal images, we have integrated our method with an advanced physically based rendering system.},

In this paper we develop a novel fluid animation control approach and we present its application to controlling breaking waves. In our Slice Method framework an animator defines the shape of a breaking wave at a desired moment in its evolution based on a library of breaking waves. Our system computes then the subsequent dynamics with the aid of a 3D Navier-Stokes solver. The wave dynamics previous to the moment the animator exerts control can also be generated based on the wave library. The animator is thus enabled to obtain a full animation of a breaking wave while controlling the shape and the timing of the breaking. An additional advantage of the method is that it provides a significantly faster method for obtaining the full 3D breaking wave evolution compared to starting the simulation at an early stage and using solely the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. We present a series of 2D and 3D breaking wave animations to demonstrate the power of the method.},

There is still no existing method that allows one to simply describe an agitated surface of any size that is visually sufficiently realistic, without using entirely physical models that are usually very complex. We present a simple method to represent and animate an ocean surface in deep water by considering it as a procedural texture. This texture is defined by a combination of two levels of detail. The first one is a superposition of 2D trochoids whose parameters are determined by ocean wave characteristics infrequency domain. In order to increase the visual complexity of this model and to reduce computation, we incorporate a 3D turbulence function to provide a second level of detail. This turbulence function is also determined by frequency characteristics of ocean waves. Since our synthesized ocean waves spectrum approaches a real ocean waves spectrum, we obtain realistic water waves in the spatial domain. The animation of our model is performed by shifting the phase of the trochoids and by moving into the 3D turbulence function. Since our definition is procedural and continuous, it permits us to obtain any size of water surface with any level of detail as well as a simple, direct, antialiasing method. Our model can be used to generate ocean waves using 2D textures or bump maps as well as 3D textures.},

We make the surprising observation that performing a single large time step with n constraint solver iterations is less effective than computing n smaller time steps, each with a single constraint solver iteration. Based on this observation, our approach is to split every visual time step into n substeps of length ∆t/n and to perform a single iteration of extended position-based dynamics ({XPBD}) in each such substep. When compared to a traditional implicit integrator with large time steps we find constraint error and damping are significantly reduced. When compared to an explicit integrator we find that our method is more stable and robust for a wider range of stiffness parameters. This result holds even when compared against more sophisticated implicit solvers based on Krylov methods. Our method is straightforward to implement, and is not sensitive to matrix conditioning nor is it to overconstrained problems.},

	abstract = {When aiming to seamlessly integrate a fluid simulation into a larger scenario (like an open ocean), careful attention must be paid to boundary conditions. In particular, one must implement special "non-reflecting" boundary conditions, which dissipate out-going waves as they exit the simulation. Unfortunately, the state of the art in non-reflecting boundary conditions (perfectly-matched layers, or {PMLs}) only permits trivially simple inflow/outflow conditions, so there is no reliable way to integrate a fluid simulation into a more complicated environment like a stormy ocean or a turbulent river. This paper introduces the first method for combining non-reflecting boundary conditions based on {PMLs} with inflow/outflow boundary conditions that vary arbitrarily throughout space and time. Our algorithm is a generalization of state-of-the-art mean-flow boundary conditions in the computational fluid dynamics literature, and it allows for seamless integration of a fluid simulation into much more complicated environments. Our method also opens the door for previously-unseen post-process effects like retroactively changing the location of solid obstacles, and locally increasing the visual detail of a pre-existing simulation.},

	url = {https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/74347},
	abstract = {In this paper, we explore how the current state of the art in real-time ocean simulations can be improved in terms of simulation accuracy, while preserving performance.  
 
Current methods, both in academia and in the industry, simulate an ocean model in frequency space on the {GPU}, convert said model on an approximately frame-byframe basis to the spatial domain using the Fourier transform, and then read back the resulting heightfield to the {CPU} as input to the application’s physics engine. We propose a fully {GPU}-based simulation framework that eliminates these {GPU} readbacks, successfully eliminating the latency-induced simulation errors present in current solutions, while preserving both ocean interactivity and performance. Along this report we also present a prototype of our framework as an Unreal Engine project. 
 
From comparing our proposed framework with the current state of the art, we find: 
• a significant correction in simulation accuracy of boats and their wakes; 
• near-equivalent {GPU} performance and improved {CPU} performance; 
• the need to rewrite certain physics behaviors for the {GPU} that are commonly available as built-in functionality in modern {CPU}-based physics engines; 
• an arguably more complicated implementation. 
 
We conclude that the errors are significant enough to consider in related work and that the proposed approach is worthwhile investigating further in future work.

The problems are placed into three categories according to their physical characteristics, namely, wave hydrodynamics and corresponding mass (air, oil, etc.) transport, wave-structure interaction, and wave-current-sediment interaction. For the first category, particle-based simulations of wave generation, propagation, breaking, as well as the associated turbulence production and dissipation, air entrainment, and mass transport, are reviewed. For wave-structure interaction, extensive structural types are considered that include fixed and moving (floating) structures, rigid and deformable structures, impermeable and porous structures, etc. For the third category, the latest advances of particle methods in wave/current interaction with sediments, i.e., sediment transport and coastal morphological changes, are outlined. This article also reviews the latest developments of particle methods with respect to enhancement of numerical stability, accuracy, efficiency and consistency in order to handle the multi-physics and multi-scale problems emerging from coastal and ocean engineering practices. Finally, the future perspectives of extending particle methods to a wider range of ocean and coastal engineering applications are highlighted.},

This structure was heavily damaged in January 2020 during the storm Gloria that hit southeastern Spain with remarkable strength. The reconstruction of the pier requires the assessment and characterization of the wave loading that determined the structural failure. Therefore, a state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamic ({CFD}) code was employed herein as an aid for a planned experimental campaign that will be carried out at the Maritime Engineering Laboratory of Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-{BarcelonaTech} ({LIM}/{UPC}). The numerical model is based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) and has been employed to simulate conditions very similar to those that manifested during the storm Gloria. The high computational cost for a full 3-D simulation has been alleviated by means of inlet boundary conditions, allowing wave generation very close to the structure. Numerical results reveal forces higher than the design loads of the pier, including both self-weight and accidental loads. This demonstrates that the main failure mechanism that led to severe structural damage of the pier during the storm is related to the exceeded lateral soil resistance. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research represents the first known application of {SPH} open boundary conditions to model a real-world engineering case.},

The model is improved from the open source code {SPHysics} (http://www.sphysics.org) by adding more advanced turbulence and rough bed treatment schemes. A modified sub-particle-scale ({SPS}) eddy viscosity model is proposed to reflect the turbulence transfer mechanisms and a modified drag force equation is included into the momentum equations to account for the existence of roughness elements on the bed as well as on the sidewalls. The computed results of various free surface patterns have been compared with the laboratory measurements of the fluctuating water surface elevations in the streamwise and spanwise directions of a rectangular open-channel flow under a range of flow conditions.

Ocean is a representative, it plays a key role in the field of virtual reality. In the research of ocean simulation based on physics, the details are not enough and the fluid-solid interaction authenticity is poor. Therefore, the fluid-solid interaction simulation of ocean simulation is important. In this paper, we propose a fluid-solid simulation method, a two-way interaction simulation between solid model and fluid particles based on control points. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) algorithm based fluid simulation is realized and B-spline function is chosen as the kernel function through the comparative analysis of Gauss kernel function, B-spline kernel function and Quintic spline kernel function. In view of the low efficiency in the process of the fluid surface reconstruction problem, we put forward a method to limit the extraction process on the surface of the fluid. We improve the boundary movement and add some random parameter values based on the direct rebound method, cut speed in a certain degree and implement a more realistic boundary movement effect. Experiment results show the simulation effects of this method.},

	abstract = {The estimation of forces and responses due to the nonlinearities in ocean waves is vital in the design of offshore structures, as these forces and responses would result in the extreme loads. Simulation of such events in a laboratory is quite laborious. Even for the preparation of the driving signals for the wave boards, one needs to resort to numerical models. In order to achieve this task, the two-dimensional time domain nonlinear problem has received considerable attention in recent years, in which a mixed Eulerian and Lagrangian method ({MEL}) is being used. Most of the conventional methods need the free surface to be smoothed or regridded at a particular/every time step of the simulation due to Lagrangian characteristics of motion even for a short time. This would cause numerical diffusion of energy in the system after a long time. In order to minimize this effect, the present study aims at fitting the free surface using a cubic spline approximation with a finite element approach for discretizing the domain. By doing so, the requirement of smoothing/regridding becomes a minimum. The efficiency of the present simulation procedure is shown for the standing wave problem. The application of this method to the problem of sloshing and wave interaction with a submerged obstacle has been carried out.},

A numerical wave generator tank, which can generate desired irregular waves is modeled by the {SPH} method. The fluid motion is governed by continuity and Navier-Stokes equations where Weakly Compressible {SPH} ({WCSPH}) approximation is employed for the numerical discretization of the problem domain. To generate the irregular wave spectrum, a flap-type wave generator is adopted into the computational domain which yields to the modeling of moving boundary conditions on the problem domain. As benchmark studies, {JONSWAP} and Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrums are simulated to validate the obtained wave characteristics with the theoretical results. The performances of the wave maker are tested under different peak wave frequency values. Fast Fourier Transformation ({FFT}) analysis is conducted to scrutinize the distribution of wave energy spectrum in the frequency domain. In the light of sufficiently long-term simulation results, it can be said that a good agreement is obtained between the numerical and theoretical results, which indicates that the presented {SPH} scheme can be utilized in further free-surface hydrodynamics studies related to the irregular wave regimes.},

	abstract = {As waves interact with the slopes of coral reefs and other steep bathymetry profiles, plunging breaking usually occurs where the free surface overturns and violent water motion is triggered. Resolving these surf zone processes pose significant challenges for conventional mesh-based hydrodynamic models, due to the rapidly-deforming nature of the free surface and associated flows. Yet the accurate prediction of these surf zone hydrodynamics is critical for predicting a wide range of nearshore processes driven by wave breaking (e.g., wave dissipation and energy transfers; mean water levels and currents; and wave runup). In this study we assess the ability of the mesh-free, Lagrangian particle-based numerical modelling approach Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) based on {DualSPHysics}, to simulate the fine-scale hydrodynamic processes driven by irregular wave transformation over a fringing reef profile, by comparing results against detailed experimental observations from a physical modelling study. To greatly improve the computational efficiency, the {SPH} model was coupled to the mesh-based multi-layer nonhydrostatic wave-flow model {SWASH}. With this coupled approach, {SWASH} was used to efficiently simulate the evolution of non-breaking waves from the wavemaker up to the fore reef slope, with the {SPH} model then used to simulate the detailed hydrodynamic processes over the reef from just offshore of the breakpoint to the shoreline. The {SPH} model was able to accurately reproduce the complex free surface deformations during plunging breaking, the spectral evolution of waves across the reef flat (including nonlinear wave shape), the mean water levels and currents, and wave runup at the shoreline. Using the long duration simulations ({\textgreater}400 wave periods), the model was able to reproduce the full range of wave motions over the reef (from sea-swell to infragravity frequencies), including the increasing dominance of low frequency waves towards the shoreline and the large cross-reef standing wave motions excited by the reef geometry.},

	abstract = {{DualSPHysics} is a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) Navier-Stokes solver initially conceived to deal with coastal engineering problems, especially those related to wave impact with coastal structures. Since the first release back in 2011, {DualSPHysics} has shown to be robust and accurate for simulating extreme wave events along with a continuous improvement in efficiency thanks to the exploitation of hardware such as graphics processing units ({GPUs}) for scientific computing or the coupling with wave propagating models such as {SWASH} and {OceanWave}3D. Numerous additional functionalities have also been included in the {DualSPHysics} package over the last few years which allow the simulation of fluid-driven objects. The use of the discrete element method ({DEM}) has allowed the solver to simulate the interaction among different bodies (sliding rocks, for example), which provides a unique tool to analyse debris flows. In addition, the recent coupling with other solvers like Project Chrono or {MoorDyn} has been a milestone in the development of the solver. Project Chrono allows the simulation of articulated structures with joints, hinges, sliders and springs and {MoorDyn} allows simulating moored structures. Both functionalities make {DualSPHysics} one of the meshless model world leaders in the simulation of offshore energy harvesting devices. Lately, the present state of maturity of the solver goes beyond single phase simulations, allowing multi-phase simulations with gas-liquid and a combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian models expanding further the capabilities and range of applications for the {DualSPHysics} solver. These advances and functionalities make {DualSPHysics} a state-of-the-art meshless solver with emphasis on free-surface flow modelling.},

Two hardware architectures are presented: one is a fully-pipelined architecture using multi-dimensional Chinese remainder theorem for a high-throughput implementation and the other is a time-multiplexed architecture, which utilises the folding transformation for the compact realisation of short-length Winograd Fourier transforms. Both designs are fully-parameterisable and have been verified against their synthesisable Verilog descriptions. The characteristics and the implementation results of the two hardware architectures on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array are presented. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study presents the first hardware realisation of {FFT} based on the combined Good-Thomas and Winograd {FFT} algorithms.

Firstly, the internal velocity of the bubble was avoided, and the bubble model was established by only considering the net flux of the inlet and outlet bubbles, which reduced the computational complexity. The bubble constraint was then introduced into the motion equation of water, and the mixed Euler–Lagrangian method was used to solve it. {FLIP} particles tracked the bubble position, velocity, and deformation, and the mesh updated the vector field. At the same time, the viscosity term was simplified. Finally, it was combined with implicit incompressible {SPH} particles to achieve the purpose of volume correction. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can present a simulation effect of bubbles in water with rich detail and a realistic sense, whether compared with actual pictures or with existing methods.},

One major disadvantage is the lack of adaptiveness, which may compromise accuracy in fluid regions such as splashes and surfaces. Attempts to address this problem used variable smoothing lengths. Yet the existing methods are computationally complex and non-efficient, because the smoothing length is typically calculated using iterative optimization. Here, we propose an efficient non-iterative {SPH} fluid simulation method with variable smoothing length ({VSLSPH}). {VSLSPH} correlates the smoothing length to the density change, and adaptively adjusts the smoothing length of particles with high accuracy and low computational cost, enabling large time steps. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the {VSLSPH} approach in terms of its simulation accuracy and efficiency.},

We use the Texel {MARSEN} {ARSLOE} ({TMA}) empirical model for the non-directional component of the wave spectrum, and compare a selection of empirically-based directional spreading functions. Additionally, we introduce a novel, normalized parameter called "swell" which modifies the directional spreading to produce wavelength-dependent elongation of waves into parallel wave trains. This paper builds upon the spectral ocean synthesis techniques popularized for computer graphics in Jerry Tessendorf's popular {SIGGRAPH} Course, "Simulating Ocean Water" and the accompanying course notes. The advancement of our spectra over the spectrum described by Tessendorf is that it readily gives plausible, attractive results for a wide range of wind speeds, ocean depths, and other physical parameters, without requiring artists to manually adjust gain and filter parameters to compensate for model inaccuracies. Our "swell" parameter additionally provides an intuitive interface for smoothly varying between choppy seas due to local storms and swells from distant weather events.},

	abstract = {Boundary handling is an important aspect of fluid simulation, and several boundary handling approaches exist in smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}), which have individual strengths and weaknesses. However, comparing different boundary handling approaches is challenging as there is no common basis for evaluations, that is, no universal set of experiments with quantitative evaluation across different methods, especially within computer animation where many evaluations rely mainly on visual perception. This article proposes a set of experiments to aid the evaluation of the main categories of fluid-boundary interactions that are important in computer animation, that is, no motion (resting) fluid, tangential and normal motion of a fluid with respect to the boundary, and a fluid impacting a corner. We propose ten experiments, comprising experimental setup and quantitative evaluation with optional visual inspections, that are arranged in four groups which focus on one of the main category of fluid-boundary interactions. We use these experiments to evaluate three particle-based boundary handling methods, that is, pressure mirroring, pressure boundaries, and moving least squares pressure extrapolation, in combination with two incompressible {SPH} fluid simulation methods, namely {IISPH} and {DFSPH}, to establish a quantifiable relation between different combinations of boundary handling with simulation approaches and the main categories of fluid-boundary interactions. Finally, we summarize all results in a rating table and show how our experiments can be used to determine the promising method for specific requirements regarding a given constellation of fluid-boundary interaction.},

changing the values of the parameters. We propose the evaluation of the designed model in a quantitative and a qualitative way. Evaluations results show that the proposed model behaves like a real one in terms of both objective trajectories and subjective perceived experience.},

Although there are solutions to the fluid-to-solid coupling problem in some particular cases, to the best of our knowledge, comprehensive and accurate computational buoyancy models adequate in general contexts are still lacking. We propose a real-time Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU}) based algorithm for realistic computation of the fluid-to-solid coupling problem, which is adequate for a wide generality of cases (solid or hollow objects, with permeable or leak-proof surfaces, and with variable masses). The method incorporates the behaviour of the fluid into which the object is immersed, and decouples the computation of the physical parameters involved in the buoyancy force of the empty object from the mass of contained liquid. The dynamics of this mass of liquid are also computed, in a way such that the relation between the centre of mass of the object and the buoyancy force may vary, leading to complex, realistic beha viours such as the ones arising for instance with a sinking boat.},

The algorithm uses a wiid wave power spectrum and generates an initial ocean wave surface via a Monte Carlo method. The linear wave dispersion relation is used to produce time sequences of ocean surfaces from the initial surface. Each of these surfaces is composed of facets that are defined by the numerical procedure. By treating each of the 'facets as a roughened surface, glitter radiance fields are generated. The reflectivity of each of the facets is a functional of the source and viewing angles, with roughness as an additional parameter. The wave height acceleration fields are also calculated from each of the ocean surfaces. A downwardacceleration threshold is used to determine whether a particular facet contains whitecaps and to determine the mean reflectivity. Thus whitecap radiance fields coherent with the glitter field are generated. The two radiance fields are then combined to generate simulated whitecap/glitter radiance fields which are compared to field data and results of these comparisons are presented.},

	url = {https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.1085340},
	abstract = {In a fully developed sea, the significant wave height (Hs) and wind speed (U10) are conventionally related to a pure quadratic equation. This relation is often violated, since in the field the measured local Hs is often contaminated by the swell, which is propagated from distant places. Therefore, a swell partition is required before the establishment of the wind-wave relation. The Spectra Energy Partition ({SEP}) is regarded as the best way to isolate the swell and the wind wave relation: it is based on the identification of a separation frequency in the ocean wave spectrum. However, for most field observations, the wave spectra information is unavailable, and thus the {SEP} is inapplicable. This work proposes a probability-based algorithm to identify the averaged swell without knowing the wave spectrum a priori. The local wind-wave relation is established by either a linear or an energy-conserved decomposition. We also find that the local wind-wave relation is a power-law when the wind speed U10 is above 4 m/s. The proposed method is first validated by applying the {SEP} method to buoy collected wave spectra data. The global pattern of the swell and the local wind waves is retrieved by applying the proposed method to a 17-year wind and wave database from the {JASON} satellite. Strong seasonal and spatial variations are obtained. Finally, a prediction model based on the empirical wind-wave relation is shown to successfully retrieve the wave field when the wind field is available.},

	abstract = {Micro-scale fluids are tiny droplets that adhere to the surface of an object as a result of rainfall, perspiration, etc. Micro-scale fluid simulation is widely used in fields such as film and games. The existing state-of-the-art simulation methods are not suitable for simulating water droplets moving on a surface due to the fact that the water droplets cannot leave the texture space and their movements always depend on the continuous {UV} region. In this study, a novel method for simulating water droplets moving on a surface is proposed. We divide the droplets into two types: (1) two-dimensional droplets and (2) three-dimensional droplets and we implement the transformation between two-dimensional droplets in the texture space and three-dimensional droplets in the physical space. In the preprocessing phase, jump textures, coordinate transform textures and force field textures are generated in the non-continuous {UV} regions on a 3D object’s surface. In the process of simulation, water droplets are treated as rigid particles. The Velocity-Verlet-based method is adopted to solve the motion trajectory equation, and the boundary droplet transport algorithm is implemented based on jump texture. In the process of rendering, the height map is generated according to the simulation in the texture space and then the liquid bridge phenomenon between the droplets is simulated based on the Gaussian blur and the color rank algorithm. Finally, they are converted into normal texture-rendering droplets. The experimental result shows that the proposed method works well when simulating the movements of water droplets on a surface in a real-time manner, and it makes the movement simulation of dimension-reducing water droplets no longer depend on the continuous surface and continuous {UV} region. Moreover, the simulation efficiency of the proposed method is two times higher than that of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method.},

This classic textbook, originally published in 1977, filled the need for a single volume on the applications of hydrodynamics to marine problems. The book is solidly based on fundamentals, but it also guides the student to an understanding of engineering applications through its consideration of realistic configurations. The book takes a balanced approach between theory and empirics, providing the necessary theoretical background for an intelligent evaluation and application of empirical procedures. It also serves as an introduction to more specialized research methods. It unifies the seemingly diverse problems of marine hydrodynamics by examining them not as separate problems but as related applications of the general field of hydrodynamics. The book evolved from a first-year graduate course in {MIT}'s Department of Ocean Engineering. A knowledge of advanced calculus is assumed. Students will find a previous introductory course in fluid dynamics helpful, but the book presents the necessary fundamentals in a self-contained manner.

The original flups library tackles that issue with an implementation of the distributed Fourier transform tailor-made for successive resolutions of unbounded Poisson problems. However the proposed implementation lacks of ﬂexibility as it only supports cell-centered data layout and features a plain communication strategy. This work extends the library along two directions. First, flups’ implementation is generalized to support a node-centered data layout. Second, three distinct approaches are provided to handle the communications: one all-to-all, and two non-blocking implementations relying on manual packing and {MPI}\_Datatype to communicate over the network. The proposed software is validated against analytical solutions for unbounded, semi-unbounded, and periodic domains. The performance of the approaches is then compared against {accFFT}, another distributed {FFT} implementation, using a periodic case. Finally the performance metrics of each implementation are analyzed and detailed on various top-tier European facilities up to 49, 152 cores. This work brings flups up to a fully production-ready and performant distributed {FFT} library, featuring all the possible types of {FFTs} and with ﬂexibility in the data-layout.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a fast time-domain boundary element method ({TDBEM}) to solve three-dimensional transient electromagnetic scattering problems regarding perfectly electric conductors in the classical marching-on-in-time manner. The algorithm of the fast {TDBEM} is a time-domain variant of the interpolation-based fast multipole method ({IFMM}), which is similar to the time-domain {IFMM} for acoustic scattering problems investigated in the author's previous studies. The principle of the present {IFMM} is to interpolate the kernel functions of the electric and magnetic field integral equations ({EFIE} and {MFIE}, respectively) so that every kernel function is expressed in a form of separation of variables in terms of both the spatial and temporal variables. Such an expression enables to construct a fast method to evaluate the scalar and vector potentials in the {EFIE} and {MFIE} with using so-called multipole-moments and local-coefficients associated with a space-time hierarchy. As opposed to \$O(N\_s{\textasciicircum}2 N\_t)\$ of the conventional {TDBEM}, the computational complexity of the fast {TDBEM} is estimated as \$O(N\_s{\textasciicircum}\{1+{\textbackslash}delta\}N\_t)\$, where \$N\_s\$ and \$N\_t\$ stand for the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom, respectively, and \${\textbackslash}delta\$ is typically \$1/2\$ or \$1/3\$. The numerical examples presented the advantages of the proposed fast {TDBEM} over the conventional {TDBEM} when solving large-scale problems.},

Good examples are the motion of a ship in the presence of water waves and the motion of a rigid structure in the presence of seismic waves. The basic goals are to determine the motion of the rigid body and the effects of the motion on the wave field, assuming linear theory is adequate. Although the underlying mathematical problems are similar, several solution methods have evolved, depending on the physical problems of interest. For ship motions, the standard approach is to decompose the problem into seven subproblems, one for each of the six rigid-body modes and one to take account of the incident wave. This approach is reviewed and then adapted to problems in acoustics and to problems in elastodynamics, such as those that arise in simple examples of soil–structure interaction. It is argued that the resulting approach for elastodynamic problems has clear advantages over those currently in use.},

However, there has been a debate about its possible inconsistencies in the context of compressible viscous flow modelling. Alternative models have been put forward that, in particular, feature the density diffusive term in the equation of mass conservation. We briefly revisit physical arguments of that debate and recall a proposal of an alternative flow model, formulated by M. Sva¨rd (2018), resulting in a purely parabolic type of the governing equation system. We present some discussion of the Sva¨rd model and an overview of its numerical aspects. We also recall our recent simplification of the model to handle low Mach number isothermal flows in the weakly compressible approach. From the purely numerical standpoint, the presence of mass diffusion in the continuity equation is beneficial as it reduces dispersive errors of simple centred discretisation schemes (numerical diffusion free). This has been confirmed in the benchmark simulations, including a doubly-periodic shear layer at low Mach numbers. The results have demonstrated high accuracy and efficiency of the mass diffusive flow model that has proven well suited for effective parallelisation.},

	abstract = {Solving complex ﬂuid-structure interaction ({FSI}) problems, which are described by nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations, is crucial in various scientiﬁc and engineering applications. Traditional computational ﬂuid dynamics based solvers are inadequate to handle the increasing demand for large-scale and long-period simulations. The ever-increasing availability of data and rapid advancement in deep learning ({DL}) have opened new avenues to tackle these challenges through data-enabled modeling. The seamless integration of {DL} and classic numerical techniques through the diﬀerentiable programming framework can signiﬁcantly improve data-driven modeling performance. In this study, we propose a diﬀerentiable hybrid neural modeling framework for eﬃcient simulation of {FSI} problems, where the numerically discretized {FSI} physics based on the immersed boundary method is seamlessly integrated with sequential neural networks using diﬀerentiable programming. All modules are programmed in {JAX}, where automatic diﬀerentiation enables gradient back-propagation over the entire model rollout trajectory, allowing the hybrid neural {FSI} model to be trained as a whole in an end-to-end, sequence-to-sequence manner. Through several {FSI} benchmark cases, we demonstrate the merit and capability of the proposed method in modeling {FSI} dynamics for both rigid and ﬂexible bodies. The proposed model has also demonstrated its superiority over baseline purely data-driven neural models, weakly-coupled hybrid neural models, and purely numerical {FSI} solvers in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.},

	abstract = {In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to accelerate numerical simulations using Graphics Processing Unit ({GPU})s. In multiphysics simulations, the various combined methodologies may have distinctly diﬀerent computational characteristics. Therefore, the best-suited hardware architecture can diﬀer between the simulation components. Furthermore, not all coupled software frameworks may support all hardware. These issues predestinate or even force hybrid implementations, i.e., diﬀerent simulation components running on diﬀerent hardware. We introduce a hybrid coupled ﬂuid-particle implementation with geometrically resolved particles. The simulation utilizes {GPUs} for the ﬂuid dynamics, whereas the particle simulation runs on Central Processing Unit ({CPU})s. We examine the performance of two contrasting cases of a ﬂuidized bed simulation on a heterogeneous supercomputer. The hybrid overhead (i.e., the {CPU}-{GPU} communication) is negligible. The ﬂuid simulation shows good performance utilizing nearly the entire memory bandwidth. Still, the {GPU} run time accounts for most of the total time. The parallel eﬃciency in a weak scaling benchmark for 1024 A100 {GPUs} is up to 71\%. Frequent {CPU}-{CPU} communications occurring in the particle simulation are the leading cause of the decrease in parallel eﬃciency. The results show that hybrid implementations are promising for large-scale multiphysics simulations on heterogeneous supercomputers.},

	abstract = {The research on free surface flow is of great interest in fluid mechanics, with the primary task being the tracking and description of the motion of free surfaces. The development of numerical simulation techniques has led to the application of new methods in the study of free surface flow problems. One such method is the Neural Particle Method ({NPM}), a meshless approach for solving incompressible free surface flow. This method is built on a Physics-Informed Neural Network ({PINN}), which allows for training and solving based solely on initial and boundary conditions. Although the {NPM} is effective in dealing with free surface flow problems, it faces challenges in simulating more complex scenarios due to the lack of additional surface recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose an improved Neural Particle Method ({INPM}) to better simulate complex free surface flow. Our approach involves incorporating alpha-shape technology to track and recognize the fluid boundary, with boundary conditions updated constantly during operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through three numerical examples with different boundary conditions. The result shows that: (1) the addition of a surface recognition module allows for the accurate tracking and recognition of the fluid boundary, enabling more precise imposition of boundary conditions in complex situations; (2) {INPM} can accurately identify the surface and calculate even when particles are unevenly distributed. Compared with traditional meshless methods, {INPM} offers a better solution for dealing with complex free surface flow problems that involve random particle distribution. Our proposed method can improve the accuracy and stability of numerical simulations for free surface flow problems.},

The purpose of {PITT} is to incorporate the knowledge of physics by embedding partial differential equations ({PDEs}) into the learning process. {PITT} uses an equation tokenization method to learn an analytically-driven numerical update operator. By tokenizing {PDEs} and embedding partial derivatives, the transformer models become aware of the underlying knowledge behind physical processes. To demonstrate this, {PITT} is tested on challenging {PDE} neural operators in both 1D and 2D prediction tasks.

While these improvements have led to a measurable performance boost (ranging from 15{\textbackslash}\% to 30{\textbackslash}\% depending on the test case and hardware configuration), it has also uncovered some of the limitations of the official {CUDA} compiler ({\textbackslash}texttt\{nvcc\}) offered by {NVIDIA}, especially in regard to developer friendliness.

	abstract = {Combinations of waves and currents exist in a wide range of marine environments. The resulting, often complex, combined wave-current conditions largely determine the loading, response and survivability of vessels, offshore platforms and systems. Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) has becoming increasingly popular for free-surface flow problems which do not require special treatment to detect the free surface. The present work implements open boundaries for wave-current conditions within the {SPH}-based {DualSPHysics} solver. Open boundaries are applied for the generation of wave-alone, current-alone and combined wave-current conditions. A modified damping zone acting on the vertical velocity component is used for wave absorption and combined with open boundaries to allow particles to leave or enter the fluid domain when a current exists. Results of wave-alone (regular, irregular and focused) and current-alone (uniform, linearly sheared and arbitrary sheared) test cases demonstrate a general numerical flume is achieved. Tests of focused waves interacting with arbitrary sheared currents are validated with analytical linear solutions for surface elevation and velocities, demonstrating excellent agreement. The numerical flume may be extended to steep waves well suited to {SPH} and thus enable modelling complex and extreme wave-current conditions interacting with offshore platforms and systems.},

	abstract = {This dissertation describes the wave particles technique for simulating water surface waves and two way fluid-object interactions for real-time applications, such as video games. Water exists in various different forms in our environment and it is important to develop necessary technologies to be able to incorporate all these forms in real-time virtual environments. Handling the behavior of large bodies of water, such as an ocean, lake, or pool, has been computationally expensive with traditional techniques even for offline graphics applications, because of the high resolution requirements of these simulations. A significant portion of water behavior for large bodies of water is the surface wave phenomenon. This dissertation discusses how water surface waves can be simulated efficiently and effectively at real-time frame rates using a simple particle system that we call "wave particles." This approach offers a simple, fast, and unconditionally stable solution to wave simulation. Unlike traditional techniques that try to simulate the water body (or its surface) as a whole with numerical techniques, wave particles merely track the deviations of the surface due to waves forming an analytical solution. This allows simulation of seemingly infinite water surfaces, like an open ocean. Both the theory and implementation of wave particles are discussed in great detail. Two-way interactions of floating objects with water is explained, including generation of waves due to object interaction and proper simulation of the effect of water on the object motion. Timing studies show that the method is scalable, allowing simulation of wave interaction with several hundreds of objects at real-time rates.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00514},
	abstract = {In this study, we establish a hybrid high-order smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) framework ({MLS}-{TENO}-{SPH}) for compressible flows with discontinuities, which is able to achieve genuine high-order convergence in smooth regions and also capture discontinuities well in non-smooth regions. The framework can be either fully Lagrangian, Eulerian or realizing arbitary-Lagrangian-Eulerian ({ALE}) feature enforcing the isotropic particle distribution in specific cases. In the proposed framework, the computational domain is divided into smooth regions and non-smooth regions, and these two regions are determined by a strong scale separation strategy in the targeted essentially non-oscillatory ({TENO}) scheme. In smooth regions, the moving-least-square ({MLS}) approximation is used for evaluating high-order derivative operator, which is able to realize genuine high-order construction; in non-smooth regions, the new {TENO} scheme based on Vila’s framework with several new improvements will be deployed to capture discontinuities and high-wavenumber flow scales with low numerical dissipation. The present {MLS}-{TENO}-{SPH} method is validated with a set of challenging cases based on the Eulerian, Lagrangian or {ALE} framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the {MLS}-{TENO}-{SPH} method features lower numerical dissipation and higher efficiency than the conventional method, and can restore genuine high-order accuracy in smooth regions. Overall, the proposed framework serves as a new exploration in high-order {SPH} methods, which are potential for compressible flow simulations with shockwaves.},

Comparisons between computed values and experimental data show satisfactory agreement in general. In particular, very good agreement is shown for the heave and pitch motions and the vertical loads. Accurate results are also obtained for the coupled sway-roll motions in beam waves. Although comparisons are not yet available for the sway-roll-yaw motions in oblique waves, the satisfactory agreement shown for the horizontal loads in oblique waves suggests that the theory may also predict the horizontal motions quite well.},

Heightfield water simulation is fast, but is especially hard to couple with rigid bodies: Usually water simply flows through the bodies. We propose a method that generalizes the extremely fast virtual pipe method to handle large, dynamic bodies. Our method diverts water around the objects. This enables us, for example, to dynamically build and destroy dams on rivers in a large virtual world.},

We show that mapping those forces to particles produces various types of waves that can be controlled by the user with only a few parameters.

The corresponding pressure is iteratively computed by solving a global formulation that is particularly useful for large numbers of rigid-rigid contacts. Compared to previous {SPH} coupling methods, the proposed concept stabilizes the fluid-rigid interface handling. It significantly reduces the computation times of {SPH} fluid simulations by enabling larger time steps. Performance gain factors of up to 58 compared to previous methods are presented. We illustrate the flexibility of the presented fluid-rigid coupling by integrating it into {DFSPH}, {IISPH}, and a recent {SPH} solver for highly viscous fluids. We further show its applicability to a recent {SPH} solver for elastic objects. Large scenarios with up to 90M particles of various interacting materials and complex contact geometries with up to 90k rigid-rigid contacts are shown. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our proposed rigid-body solver by comparing it to Bullet.},

Our approach samples the surface of rigid bodies with boundary particles that interact with the fluid, preventing deficiency issues and both spatial and temporal discontinuities. The problem of inhomogeneous boundary sampling is addressed by considering the relative contribution of a boundary particle to a physical quantity. This facilitates not only the initialization process but also allows the simulation of multiple dynamic objects. Thin structures consisting of only one layer or one line of boundary particles, and also non-manifold geometries can be handled without any additional treatment. We have integrated our approach into {WCSPH} and {PCISPH}, and demonstrate its stability and flexibility with several scenarios including multiphase flow.},

For these type of applications, Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNN}) that use Multiple Downsampled Branches ({MDBs}) to efficiently encode spatial information from different spatial scales have proven to be some of the most successful architectures. However, not many guidelines exist to build these architectures, particularly when applied to more challenging 3D configurations. Thus, this work focuses on studying the impact of the choice of the number of down-sampled branches, accuracy and performance-wise in 3D incompressible fluid test cases, where a {CNN} is used to solve the Poisson equation. The influence of this parameter is assessed by performing multiple trainings of Unet architectures with varying {MDBs} on a cloud-computing environment. These trained networks are then tested on two 3D {CFD} problems: a plume and a Von Karman vortex street at various operating points, where the solution of the neural network is coupled to a nonlinear advection equation.},

We use graph-based approaches to model differentiating cells, which provides a spatio-temporal characterization of developmental trajectories and defines the transcriptional architecture that accompanies the emergence of the first (primitive or extra-embryonic) endodermal population and its sister pluripotent (embryonic) epiblast lineage. We uncover a relationship between descendants of these two lineages, in which epiblast cells differentiate into endoderm at two distinct time points—before and during gastrulation. Trajectories of endoderm cells were mapped as they acquired embryonic versus extra-embryonic fates and as they spatially converged within the nascent gut endoderm, which revealed these cells to be globally similar but retain aspects of their lineage history. We observed the regionalized identity of cells along the anterior–posterior axis of the emergent gut tube, which reflects their embryonic or extra-embryonic origin, and the coordinated patterning of these cells into organ-specific territories.},

However, simulation and rendering of a large number of water particles is very time consuming and it is very hard to achieve real-time frame rate (due to the huge computational cost required), e.g., those found in feature movies and offline products [Flip Fluids2022], or tools (e.g., Houdini and Blender). That is why most water visual effects in modern games are either simulated as only a 2D shallow-water in which simulation is calculated in 2D grid and projected onto the heightfield, as in [Fluid Flux 2022], or are baked at preprocessing stage which does not allow the player to dynamically interact with the liquid at runtime, as a result, lots of the fun of interactivity is lost. This course will discuss the state-of-the-art and production-proven techniques involved in building a real-time system on {GPUs} for simulation and rendering of realistic 3D liquid with millions of particles. It also discusses how to integrate the system into modern game engines (like {UE}5), with some show-cases of real applications in gaming environments.},

	abstract = {This new method for calculating wave forces on offshore structures is based on an extension of Airy theory for two-dimensional waves and uses a linear filtering technique to calculate wave forces as a function of time for wave profiles of arbitrary shape and length.Interest in wave-force predictions has been increasing in recent years with the increasing worldwide investment in offshore operations and the movement into deeper water. The larger structures required in deeper water increase the need for rapid and accurate waveforce predictions. This paper presents a method for computing wave forces from an ocean-wave profile by a linear filtering technique and compares these computed forces with measurements. The linear filter employed is developed from a modification of small-amplitude wave theory suggested by wave-tank studies and used to calculate water velocities and accelerations. In the linear filtering method, a wave train of any length and any degree of irregularity can be used in design and dynamic studies of offshore structures. Further, the change of the wave profile shape with time (dispersion) can be allowed for. Velocities and accelerations calculated with the linear filter and introduced into an equation proposed by Morison et al. permits calculation of wave forces. Force coefficients required in Morison's equation were determined by fitting calculated forces to observed hurricane wave-force measurements. Consequently, the force coefficients should be used only with the calculation procedures presented in this paper; further, their application has been limited to calculation of forces on members similar in size and surface properties to the test member used to obtain the measured properties to the test member used to obtain the measured forces.The force predictions are compared with force measurements made in about 400 waves at various heights along a 44-in.-diameter piling in 99 ft of water during Hurricane Carla in 1961. The procedure gives acceptable prediction of maximum forces at all heights above bottom. Force profiles in the four largest measured waves are reproduced with reasonable fidelity, and the peak forces in these largest waves are closely reproduced. Additional force measurements made in shallow water (34 ft) are not referred to in this paper. The wave theory used is less applicable in shallow water, leading to considerable scatter in fitting results. The force measurements indicate that wave forces fall off sharply near the surface of the water. Reproduction of the actual flow regime near the wave surface requires further modification of any way theory. This additional modification is not discussed here.Procedure Used to Predict Wave Forces Procedure Used to Predict Wave Forces Force {EquationThe} horizontal force per foot of vertical piling length is calculated as a function of time t and height z above the ocean bottom as:(1)Eq. 1, proposed by Morison et al., represents the total force as a sum of drag and inertial forces.{JPTP}. 359},

	abstract = {Performance of a new incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (I-{SPH}) model for simulating free surface flows using Lagrangian description of motion is numerically evaluated. In the {SPH} method, kernel or weight functions are used for approximation of a function and its spatial derivatives based on the theory of integral interpolants exhibiting poor accuracy. In this study, the pressure field is obtained by solving a pressure Poisson equation that is derived from a two-step prediction–correction approach applied for temporal discretization of the governing equations of fluid flows and enforcement of incompressibility. A newly developed gradient model in the context of the mesh-less moving particle semi-implicit ({MPS}) method is applied to improve the standard gradient and Laplacian models of I-{SPH} method in the proposed approach. The higher accuracy of the modified {SPH} scheme, which is a kernel gradient-free model, in comparison with the standard I-{SPH} method is validated trough solving the classic benchmark problems including the dam break flow, solitary wave propagation, standing wave motion, liquid sloshing and water drop stretching.},

	abstract = {Building animation tools for ﬂuid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for ﬂuid ﬂow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling ﬂuid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of ﬂows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical ﬂuid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a ﬂuid. In this paper, for the ﬁrst time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex ﬂuid-like ﬂows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many ﬂuid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Analysis of the directional spectra of typical sets of surface wave data obtained in the open sea as well asa bay using a cloverleaf buoy system are reported. It is shown that the directional wave spectrum can be approximated by the product of the frequencyspectrum and a unimodal angular distribution with mean direction approximately equal to that of thewind, and that various forms of frequency spectra exist, even in relatively simple wave systems, dependingon their generating conditions. Ocean waves at fairly short dimensionless fetches show spectral forms withvery narrow spectral width, which are similar to those of laboratory wind waves. On the other hand, thespectral forms for ocean waves at very long dimensionless fetches are quite similar to the Pierson-Moskowitzspectra, which are considered, within our present data, to be the wave spectra with the largest spectral width.Finally, there exist many ocean waves at moderate dimensionless fetches, which show spectral forms with interminate spectral widths lying between the above two extremes. However, a definite relationship betweenthe spectral width and the dimensionless fetch has not been obtained in the present study. Concerning the angular distribution, it is shown that the shape of the angular distribution is dependenton the frequency of the spectral component even in a simple wave system in a generating area, althoughthe mean directions ot the spectral components are independent of the frequency and approximately equalto the wind direction. The angular distribution is very narrow for frequencies near the dominant peak of thefrequency spectrum, whereas it widens rapidly toward high and low frequencies. Thus, the major energy-containing frequency components propagate in almost the same direction as the wind with the least angularspreading. Finally, it is shown that a similarity law is satisfied for the angular distributions, and an idealized formof the angular distribution function is derived for practical purposes.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium spectral behavior for ocean gravity wind waves has been investigated actively over the past three decades, yet fundamental problems remain in reconciling theory with observations. Predicted equilibrium spectral forms from physical models proposed recently by Kitaigorodskii and by Phillips are examined in the light of wavenumber and frequency spectra reported by several investigators. While frequency domain observations appear to support the model predictions, observed wavenumber spectra are found to differ both in the spectral dependence on wavenumber and on the wind speed.

Based on observed wavenumber and frequency spectra for fetch-limited condition a model is proposed for the form of the directional wavenumber spectrum slice in the dominant wave direction. Reduced wavenumber and frequency spectra are calculated from this model, assuming an empirical spectral directional spreading function and the linear gravity wave dispersion relation. These calculations reveal the underlying influences which shape these reduced spectra. In the energy containing subrange, just above the spectral peak, the dominant influence shaping these spectra is the variation of the directional spreading function with distance from the spectral peak. For frequency spectra, at higher frequencies, the model calculations predict that the range of observed frequency spectral dependences is due primarily to the Doppler shifting from advection of the shorter waves by the orbital motion of the dominant waves, with possible additional influences of wind drift and ambient currents.

Combining these results, composite calculated frequency spectra and one-dimensional wavenumber spectra show close correspondence with measured field spectra. In addition to clarifying the key processes that shape different regimes in the frequency spectrum, a refinement of the bounds of the gravity equilibrium subrange is proposed.},

	abstract = {The conventional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method is inherently an explicit scheme; the modeling of weakly compressible ﬂows must imply an equation of state to link the mass density with the pressure. Unfortunately, the {SPH} scheme has an outstandingly high computational performance requirement, especially in the case of small time step sizes applied due to the large stiﬀness. Therefore in practice, the speed of sound is usually reduced artiﬁcially to meet the requirements of the given ﬂuid ﬂow problem in terms of the compressibility rate. Unfortunately, this approach still demands very low time step sizes in most cases. In this paper, we introduce an excessively simple improvement of the weakly compressible variant of the {SPH} scheme to achieve a considerably stiﬀer ﬂuid without the demand for a smaller time step size and additional computational requirement. The present work’s motivation was to eliminate the remnant density variance under constant pressure by introducing an integral and diﬀerential term in the equation of state analogously with {ProportionalâA}˘ S¸ {IntegralâA}˘ S¸ Derivative ({PID}) controls. The model was tested through simple two-dimensional hydrostatic and dam break cases.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01581},
	abstract = {The error of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) using kernel for particle-based approximation mainly comes from smoothing and integration errors. The choice of kernels has a significant impact on the numerical accuracy, stability and computational efficiency. At present, the most popular kernels such as B-spline, truncated Gaussian (for compact support), Wendland kernels have 2nd-order smoothing error and Wendland kernel becomes mainstream in {SPH} community as its stability and accuracy. Due to the fact that the particle distribution after relaxation can achieve fast convergence of integration error respected to support radius, it is logical to choose kernels with higher-order smoothing error to improve the numerical accuracy. In this paper, the error of 4th-order Laguerre-Wendland kernel proposed by Litvinov et al. {\textbackslash}cite\{litvinov2015towards\} is revisited and another 4th-order truncated Laguerre-Gauss kernel is further analyzed and considered to replace the widely used Wendland kernel. The proposed kernel has following three properties: One is that it avoids the pair-instability problem during the relaxation process, unlike the original truncated Gaussian kernel, and achieves much less relaxation residue than Wendland and Laguerre-Wendland kernels; One is the truncated compact support size is the same as the non-truncated compact support of Wendland kernel, which leads to both kernels' computational efficiency at the same level; Another is that the truncation error of this kernel is much less than that of Wendland kernel. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of \$2D\$ and \$3D\$ benchmark cases on Eulerian {SPH} for fluid dynamics and total Lagrangian {SPH} for solid dynamics validate the considerably improved numerical accuracy by using truncated Laguerre-Gauss kernel without introducing extra computational effort.},

The abstract concept of velocity-based constraints is presented, which generalizes the formulations of the incompressibility constraint and inter-rigid-body contacts and provides a generic way to achieve strongly coupled simulation. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the method, which includes rigid-body computation, hydrostatic pressure, dam-break computation, and circular parch computation for incompressible fluid, buoyancy and seesaw computation for interaction of incompressible fluid and rigid bodies, and complex-scene computation for overall behavior and stability.},

Simulating the 3D dynamic motion of such materials represents a challenging problem in graphics because of their unique physical properties. In this paper we present a simple and effective method for granular material simulation. By incorporating techniques from physical models, our approach describes granular phenomena more faithfully than previous methods. Granular material is represented by a large collection of non-spherical particles which may be in persistent contact. The particles represent discrete elements of the simulated material. One major advantage of using discrete elements is that the topology of particle interaction can evolve freely. As a result, highly dynamic phenomena, such as splashing and avalanches, can be conveniently generated by this meshless approach without sacriﬁcing physical accuracy. We generalize this discrete model to rigid bodies by distributing particles over their surfaces. In this way, two-way coupling between granular materials and rigid bodies is achieved.},

	abstract = {A common way to handle boundaries in {SPH} fluid simulations is to sample the surface of the boundary geometry using particles. These boundary particles are assigned the same properties as the fluid particles and are considered in the pressure force computation to avoid a penetration of the boundary. However, the pressure solver requires a pressure value for each particle. These are typically not computed for the boundary particles due to the computational overhead. Therefore, several strategies have been investigated in previous works to obtain boundary pressure values. A popular, simple technique is pressure mirroring, which mirrors the values from the fluid particles. This method is efficient, but may cause visual artifacts. More complex approaches like pressure extrapolation aim to avoid these artifacts at the cost of computation time. We introduce a constraint-based derivation of Divergence-Free {SPH} ({DFSPH}) — a common state-of-the-art pressure solver. This derivation gives us new insights on how to integrate boundary particles in the pressure solve without the need of explicitly computing boundary pressure values. This yields a more elegant formulation of the pressure solver that avoids the aforementioned problems.},

	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method is widely accepted as a flexible numerical treatment for surface boundaries and interactions. High-resolution simulations of hydrodynamic events require high-performance computing ({HPC}). There is a need for an {SPH} code that runs efficiently on modern supercomputers involving accelerators such as {NVIDIA} or {AMD} graphics processing units. In this work, we applied half-precision, which is widely used in artificial intelligence, to the {SPH} method. However, improving {HPC} performance at such low-order precisions is a challenge. An as-is implementation with half-precision will have lower computational cost than that of float/double precision simulations, but also worsens the simulation accuracy. We propose a scaling and shifting method that maintains the simulation accuracy near the level of float/double precision. By examining the impact of half-precision on the simulation accuracy and time-to-solution, we demonstrated that the use of half-precision can improve the computational performance of {SPH} simulations for scientific purposes without sacrificing the accuracy. In addition, we demonstrated that the efficiency of half-precision depends on the architecture used.},

	abstract = {We propose a two-scale method for particle-based ﬂuids that allocates computing resources to regions of the ﬂuid where complex ﬂow behavior emerges. Our method uses a low- and a highresolution simulation that run at the same time. While in the coarse simulation the whole ﬂuid is represented by large particles, the ﬁne level simulates only a subset of the ﬂuid with small particles. The subset can be arbitrarily deﬁned and also dynamically change over time to capture complex ﬂows and small-scale surface details. The low- and high-resolution simulations are coupled by including feedback forces and deﬁning appropriate boundary conditions. Our method offers the beneﬁt that particles are of the same size within each simulation level. This avoids particle splitting and merging processes, and allows the simulation of very large resolution differences without any stability problems. The model is easy to implement, and we show how it can be integrated into a standard {SPH} simulation as well as into the incompressible {PCISPH} solver. Compared to the single-resolution simulation, our method produces similar surface details while improving the efﬁciency linearly to the achieved reduction rate of the particle number.},

	abstract = {An algorithm for coupling the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method and the finite element method ({FEM}) is proposed for fluid–structure interaction ({FSI}) problems. The {SPH} module solves the fluid motion, and the {FEM} module describes the deformation of structures. In the algorithm, a structure is considered as a solid boundary in the {SPH} module and dealt with using the dynamic boundary condition. Only three layers of {SPH} boundary particles are set to represent the structure surface, and the interaction forces between the {SPH} boundary and fluid particles, including the water pressure and the viscous shear stress, are quantified in a same way as the inter-fluid particle forces. Further, the computed forces on the {SPH} boundary particles exerted by the fluid are redistributed to the structure {FEM} nodes based on a well-defined projection scheme. In the {FEM} module, the deformation and motion of the structure under the exerted fluid forces are solved, and accordingly, the position and velocity of the {SPH} boundary particles are updated by interpolation from the new properties at the {FEM} nodes. The proposed {SPH}-{FEM} coupled model is validated in three {FSI} benchmarks. For the deformation of an elastic plate under hydrostatic water pressure, the relative difference between the computed and the analytical maximum vertical displacement at the plate midpoint is about 1.5\%. For the deformation of an elastic gate subjected to a time-varying dam-break flow, the relative root mean squared errors in the computed vertical and horizontal displacement of the gate are, respectively, 5.5\% and 2.2\%. It is demonstrated that the proposed model performs well in simulating the deformation of structures under both hydrostatic water pressure and dynamic impacts of dam-break flows.},

Our contribution is the derivation and implementation of an implicit cohesion force based approach for the simulation of surface tension effects using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method. We define a continuous formulation inspired by the properties of surface tension at the molecular scale which is spatially discretized using {SPH}. An adapted variant of the linearized backward Euler method is used for time discretization, which we also strongly couple with an implicit viscosity model. Finally, we extend our formulation with adhesion forces for interfaces with rigid objects.
            Existing {SPH} approaches for surface tension in computer graphics are mostly based on explicit time integration, thereby lacking in stability for challenging settings. We compare our implicit surface tension method to these approaches and further evaluate our model on a wider variety of complex scenarios, showcasing its efficacy and versatility. Among others, these include but are not limited to simulations of a water crown, a dripping faucet and a droplet-toy.},

	abstract = {We present a hydrodynamic simulation system using the {GPU} compute shaders of {DirectX} for simulating virtual agent behaviors and navigation inside a smoothed particle hydrodynamical ({SPH}) fluid environment with real-time water mesh surface reconstruction. The current {SPH} literature includes interactions between {SPH} and heterogeneous meshes but seldom involves interactions between {SPH} and virtual boid agents. The contribution of the system lies in the combination of the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics model with the distributed boid model of virtual agents to enable agents to interact with fluids. The agents based on the boid algorithm influence the motion of {SPH} fluid particles, and the forces from the {SPH} algorithm affect the movement of the boids. To enable realistic fluid rendering and simulation in a particle-based system, it is essential to construct a mesh from the particle attributes. Our system also contributes to the surface reconstruction aspect of the pipeline, in which we performed a set of experiments with the parallel marching cubes algorithm per frame for constructing the mesh from the fluid particles in a real-time compute and memoryintensive application, producing a wide range of triangle configurations. We also demonstrate that our system is versatile enough for reinforced robotic agents instead of boid agents to interact with the fluid environment for underwater navigation and remote control engineering purposes.},

	abstract = {Realistic handling of ﬂuid-air and ﬂuid-solid interfaces in {SPH} is a challenging problem. The main reason is that some important physical phenomena such as surface tension and adhesion emerge as a result of inter-molecular forces in a microscopic scale. This is different from scalar ﬁelds such as ﬂuid pressure, which can be plausibly evaluated on a macroscopic scale using particles. Although there exist techniques to address this problem for some speciﬁc simulation scenarios, there does not yet exist a general approach to reproduce the variety of effects that emerge in reality from ﬂuidair and ﬂuid-solid interactions. In order to address this problem, we present a new surface tension force and a new adhesion force. Different from the existing work, our surface tension force can handle large surface tensions in a realistic way. This property lets our approach handle challenging real scenarios, such as water crown formation, various types of ﬂuid-solid interactions, and even droplet simulations. Furthermore, it prevents particle clustering at the free surface where inter-particle pressure forces are incorrect. Our adhesion force allows plausible two-way attraction of ﬂuids and solids and can be used to model different wetting conditions. By using our forces, modeling surface tension and adhesion effects do not require involved techniques such as generating a ghost air phase or surface tracking. The forces are applied to the neighboring ﬂuidﬂuid and ﬂuid-boundary particle pairs in a symmetric way, which satisﬁes momentum conservation. We demonstrate that combining both forces allows simulating a variety of interesting effects in a plausible way.},

	abstract = {Six-degree-of-freedom (6-{DOF}) motions of structures widely exist in aeronautics and ocean engineering. It is significant to study the 6-{DOF} motion for simulating the trajectory and impact load of structures. This paper uses the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method combined with some modified numerical techniques to simulate the fluid-solid interactions ({FSI}), then a quaternion-based method is adopted to simulate the free motion of rigid bodies, where the calculation process of 6-{DOF} motions based on quaternion is elaborated in detail. The accuracy of this method is verified through two benchmark tests, including water entry of a cuboid and skipping stone, which can prove the pressure calculation and motion prediction of rigid bodies are consistent with the experimental results. At last, the 6-{DOF} ditching process of a seaplane is simulated by the quaternion method embedded in the {SPH} model, and the simulation results are consistent with those simulated by the finite volume method ({FVM}). The above three tests demonstrate that the {SPH} model combined with a 6-{DOF} quaternion-based solver can accurately solve {FSI} problems from basic to complex at different scales. Besides, the {SPH} model shows significant advantages in capturing large-deformed free surfaces and splashing droplets compared with Eulerian-grid-based methods.},

For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible {SPH} ({PCISPH}) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible {SPH} ({WCSPH}) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the {WCSPH} results.},

We then solve the two wave regimes separately using appropriate state-of-the-art techniques, and re-combine the resulting wave velocities at the end of each step. This strategy leads to the first heightfield wave model capable of simulating complex interactions between both deep and shallow water effects, like the waves from a boat wake sloshing up onto a beach, or a dam break producing wave interference patterns and eddies. We also analyze the numerical dispersion created by our method and derive an exact correction factor for waves at a constant water depth, giving us a numerically perfect re-creation of theoretical water wave dispersion patterns.},

	abstract = {In the {SPH} method for viscous ﬂuids, the time step is subject to empirical stability criteria. We proceed to a stability analysis of the Weakly Compressible {SPH} equations using the von Neumann approach in arbitrary space dimension for unbounded ﬂow. Considering the continuous {SPH} interpolant based on integrals, we obtain a theoretical stability criterion for the time step, depending on the kernel standard deviation, the speed of sound and the viscosity. The stability domain appears to be almost independent of the kernel choice for a given space discretization. Numerical tests show that the theory is very accurate, despite the approximations made. We then extend the theory in order to study the inﬂuence of the method used to compute the density, of the gradient and divergence {SPH} operators, of background pressure, of the model used for viscous forces and of a constant velocity gradient. The inﬂuence of time integration scheme is also studied, and proved to be prominent. All of the above theoretical developments give excellent agreement against numerical results. It is found that velocity gradients almost do not aﬀect stability, provided some background pressure is used. Finally, the case of bounded ﬂows is brieﬂy addressed from numerical tests in three cases: a laminar Poiseuille ﬂow in a pipe, a lid-driven cavity and the collapse of a water column on a wedge.},

In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) to simulate ﬂuids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the {SPH}-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards ﬂuid simulation by deriving the force density ﬁelds directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the ﬂuid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to quickly initialize additional fluid in a rest state in simulations with any 3D boundary shape and able to preserve any already existing fluid. Our approach only uses the density property of the particles to allow compatibility with any smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulation scheme and any boundaries model. This initialization method is fast enough to allow the initialization of new fluid volumes interactively while the simulation is running.

Particle methods are a versatile and widely used class of algorithms for computer simulations and numerical predictions in various applications, ranging from continuum fluid dynamics and granular flows, using methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) and Discrete Element Methods ({DEM}) to Molecular Dynamics ({MD}) simulations in molecular modeling. Particle methods naturally lend themselves to implementation on parallel-computing hardware. So far, however, a mathematical proof of correctness and equivalence to sequential implementations was only available for shared-memory parallelism. Here, we leverage a formal definition of the algorithmic class of particle methods to provide a proven parallelization scheme for distributed-memory computers. We prove that these parallelized particle methods on distributed memory computers are formally equivalent to their sequential counterpart for a well-defined class of particle methods. Notably, the here analyzed parallelization scheme is well-known and commonly used. Our analysis is, therefore, of immediate practical relevance to existing and new parallel software implementations of particle methods and places them on solid theoretical grounds.},

	abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) is essential for modeling complex large-deformation problems across various applications, requiring significant computational power. A major portion of {SPH} computation time is dedicated to the Nearest Neighboring Particle Search ({NNPS}) process. While advanced {NNPS} algorithms have been developed to enhance {SPH} efficiency, the potential efficiency gains from modern computation hardware remain underexplored. This study investigates the impact of {GPU} parallel architecture, low-precision computing on {GPUs}, and {GPU} memory management on {NNPS} efficiency. Our approach employs a {GPU}-accelerated mixed-precision {SPH} framework, utilizing lowprecision float-point 16 ({FP}16) for {NNPS} while maintaining high precision for other components. To ensure {FP}16 accuracy in {NNPS}, we introduce a Relative Coordinated-based Link List ({RCLL}) algorithm, storing {FP}16 relative coordinates of particles within background cells. Our testing results show three significant speedup rounds for {CPU}-based {NNPS} algorithms. The first comes from parallel {GPU} computations, with up to a 1000x efficiency gain. The second is achieved through low-precision {GPU} computing, where the proposed {FP}16-based {RCLL} algorithm offers a 1.5x efficiency improvement over the {FP}64-based approach on {GPUs}. By optimizing {GPU} memory bandwidth utilization, the efficiency of the {FP}16 {RCLL} algorithm can be further boosted by 2.7x, as demonstrated in an example with 1 million particles.

The novelty of this study lies in the method proposed for estimating the wave parameters using the brightness period. Although this is a simple method, we confirmed that the wave parameters for windsea, such as the significant wave height and significant wave period, can be estimated with high accuracy using the brightness period.

The increase in the number {NH} of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the {SPH} resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all {NH}, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the {SPH} density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher order B-splines, allowing large {NH} and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sublinear with {NH}). Our analysis also shows that at low {NH} the quartic spline kernel with {NH} ≈ 60 obtains much better convergence than the standard cubic spline.},

	abstract = {In classical smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) fluid simulation approaches, the smoothing length of Lagrangian particles is typically constant. One major disadvantage is the lack of adaptiveness, which may compromise accuracy in fluid regions such as splashes and surfaces. Attempts to address this problem used variable smoothing lengths. Yet the existing methods are computationally complex and non-efficient, because the smoothing length is typically calculated using iterative optimization. Here, we propose an efficient non-iterative {SPH} fluid simulation method with variable smoothing length ({VSLSPH}). {VSLSPH} correlates the smoothing length to the density change, and adaptively adjusts the smoothing length of particles with high accuracy and low computational cost, enabling large time steps. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the {VSLSPH} approach in terms of its simulation accuracy and efficiency.},

We consider existing boundary treatment methods in {SPH} and propose some modifications to these methods so that they can be used for compressible flows. We also propose a novel Transport Velocity Formulation ({TVF}) based shield to persuasively prevent particle penetration at the boundaries. The proposed boundary treatment method is easy to implement and does not require problem-specific tuning. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques with a large suite of test problems that do not seem to have been simulated with {SPH} in the literature thus far.

Such approaches allow to explicitly and independently process shear rate, spin, and expansion rate. This can be used to, e.g., avoid interferences between pressure and viscosity solvers. Another interesting aspect is the possibility to explicitly process the vorticity, e.g., to preserve the vorticity. In this context, this paper proposes a novel variant of the prescribed-gradient idea that handles vorticity in a physically motivated way. In contrast to a less appropriate vorticity preservation that has been used in a previous approach, vorticity is diffused. The paper illustrates the utility of the vorticity diffusion. Therefore, comparisons of the proposed vorticity diffusion with vorticity preservation and additionally with vorticity damping are presented. The paper further discusses the relation between prescribed velocity gradients and prescribed velocity Laplacians which improves the intuition behind the prescribed-gradient method for highly viscous {SPH} fluids. Finally, the paper discusses the relation of the proposed method to a physically correct implicit viscosity formulation.},

We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to solve the full form of viscosity, constructing a sparse linear system with a symmetric positive definite matrix, while exploiting the variational principle that automatically enforces the boundary condition on free surfaces. We also propose a new method for extracting coefficients of the matrix contributed by second-ring neighbor particles to efficiently solve the linear system using a conjugate gradient solver.

The most efﬁcient {SPH}-based approaches enforce incompressibility either on position or velocity level. However, the continuity equation for incompressible ﬂow demands to maintain a constant density and a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld. We propose a combination of two novel implicit pressure solvers enforcing both a low volume compression as well as a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld. While a compression-free ﬂuid is essential for realistic physical behavior, a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld drastically reduces the number of required solver iterations and increases the stability of the simulation signiﬁcantly. Thanks to the improved stability, our method can handle larger time steps than previous approaches. This results in a substantial performance gain since the computationally expensive neighborhood search has to be performed less frequently. Moreover, we introduce a third optional implicit solver to simulate highly viscous ﬂuids which seamlessly integrates into our solver framework. Our implicit viscosity solver produces realistic results while introducing almost no numerical damping. We demonstrate the efﬁciency, robustness and scalability of our method in a variety of complex simulations including scenarios with millions of turbulent particles or highly viscous materials.},

Our method is the result of a theoretical and practical in-depth analysis of the most recent implicit {SPH} solvers for viscous materials. Based on our ﬁndings, we developed a list of requirements that are vital to produce a realistic motion of a viscous ﬂuid. These essential requirements include momentum conservation, a physically meaningful behavior under temporal and spatial reﬁnement, the absence of ghost forces induced by spurious viscosities and the ability to reproduce complex physical effects that can be observed in nature. On the basis of several theoretical analyses, quantitative academic comparisons and complex visual experiments we show that none of the recent approaches is able to satisfy all requirements. In contrast, our proposed method meets all demands and therefore produces realistic animations in highly complex scenarios. We demonstrate that our solver outperforms former approaches in terms of physical accuracy and memory consumption while it is comparable in terms of computational performance. In addition to the implicit viscosity solver, we present a method to simulate melting objects.

	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) is omnipresent in modern engineering and scientific disciplines. {SPH} is a class of Lagrangian schemes that discretize fluid dynamics via finite material points that are tracked through the evolving velocity field. Due to the particle-like nature of the simulation, graph neural networks ({GNNs}) have emerged as appealing and successful surrogates. However, the practical utility of such {GNN}-based simulators relies on their ability to faithfully model physics, providing accurate and stable predictions over long time horizons – which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we identify particle clustering originating from tensile instabilities as one of the primary pitfalls. Based on these insights, we enhance both training and rollout inference of state-of-the-art {GNN}-based simulators with varying components from standard {SPH} solvers, including pressure, viscous, and external force components. All neural {SPH}-enhanced simulators achieve better performance, often by orders of magnitude, than the baseline {GNNs}, allowing for significantly longer rollouts and significantly better physics modeling.

	abstract = {The smoothed particle hydrodynamic technique is strongly based on the proper choice of interpolation functions. This statement is particularly relevant for the study of subsonic fluxes and turbulence, where inherent small errors in the averaging procedures introduce excessive damping on the smallest scales. To mitigate these errors we can increase both the number of interpolating points and the order of the interpolating kernel function. However, this approach leads to a higher computational burden across all fluid regions. Ideally, the development of a single kernel function capable of effectively accommodating varying numbers of interpolating points in different fluid regions, providing good resolution and minimal errors would be highly desirable. In this work, we revisit and extend the main properties of a family of interpolators called Sinc kernels and compare them with the widely used family of Wendland kernels. We show that a linear combination of low- and high-order Sinc kernels generates good-quality interpolators, which are resistant to pairing instability while maintaining good sampling properties in a wide range of neighbor interpolating points, 60 ≤ 𝑛𝑏 ≤ 400. We show that a particular case of this linear mix of Sincs produces a well-balanced and robust kernel that improves previous results in the Gresho-Chan vortex experiment even when the number of neighbors is not large, while yielding a good convergence rate. Although such a mixing technique is ideally suited for Sinc kernels owing to their excellent flexibility, it can be easily applied to other interpolating families such as the B-splines and Wendland kernels.},

This formulation enables systematic multiphysics integration in which interactions are modeled via similar constraints between the fluid pseudoparticles and impenetrable surfaces of other bodies. These conditions embody Archimede's principle for solids and thus buoyancy results as a direct consequence. We use a variational time stepping scheme suitable for general constrained multibody systems we call {SPOOK}. Each step requires the solution of only one Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem ({MLCP}) with very few inequalities, corresponding to solid boundary conditions. We solve this {MLCP} with a fast iterative method. Overall stability is vastly improved in comparison to the unconstrained version of {SPH}, and this allows much larger time steps, and an increase in overall performance by two orders of magnitude. Proof of concept is given for computer graphics applications and interactive simulations.},

Multilevel and Krylov subspace methods have been proven to be the most efﬁcient among various iterative methods. Recently, the scheduled relaxation Jacobi technique has been developed, which can be used as a standalone iterative solver as well as a preconditioner to the Krylov subspace methods. The relaxed Jacobi ({RJ}) method has also been implemented as a smoother in the multigrid method, with no-post smoothening. Here, the focus is to test the performance of relaxed Jacobi when applied to the large scale Poisson problems. Multigrid methods with both post-smoothening and pre-smoothening operations have been conducted in this paper. The methodology is applied to a rectangular domain using structured Cartesian grids. Also, multigrid methods with relaxed Jacobi smoothers are used as preconditioners to Krylov subspace solvers, and their performances are compared with the red-black Gauss-Seidel smoothers. Similar to the results in the literature, {RJ} smoothers to multigrid techniques provide better results than Gauss-Seidel smoothers when no-post smoothening operations are carried out. However, the use of post-smoothening operations changed the entire dynamic of the {RJ} smoothers.},

	abstract = {Deep neural network based surrogates for partial differential equations have recently gained increased interest. However, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. A prominent example is the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification in computational fluid dynamics, posing a challenge for neural networks to effectively model particle- as opposed to grid-based dynamics. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers ({UPTs}), a novel learning paradigm which models a wide range of spatio-temporal problems - both for Lagrangian and Eulerian discretization schemes. {UPTs} operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility across meshes and particles. {UPTs} efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, {UPTs} allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of {UPTs} in mesh-based fluid simulations, steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) has shown to be a simple, yet ﬂexible method to cope with many ﬂuid simulation problems in a robust way. Unfortunately, the results obtained when using {SPH} to simulate miscible ﬂuids are severely affected, especially if density ratios become large. The undesirable effects reach from unphysical density and pressure variations to spurious and unnatural interface tensions, as well as severe numerical instabilities. In this work, we present a formulation based on {SPH} which can handle density discontinuities at interfaces between multiple ﬂuids correctly without increasing the computational costs compared to standard {SPH}. The basic idea is to replace the density computation in {SPH} by a measure of particle densities and consequently derive new formulations for pressure and viscous forces. The new method enables the user to select the desired amount of interface tension according to the simulation problem at hand. We succeed to stably simulate multiple ﬂuids with high density contrasts without the above described artifacts apparent in standard {SPH} simulations.},

Simulating the 3D dynamic motion of such materials represents a challenging problem in graphics because of their unique physical properties. In this paper we present a simple and effective method for granular material simulation. By incorporating techniques from physical models, our approach describes granular phenomena more faithfully than previous methods. Granular material is represented by a large collection of non-spherical particles which may be in persistent contact. The particles represent discrete elements of the simulated material. One major advantage of using discrete elements is that the topology of particle interaction can evolve freely. As a result, highly dynamic phenomena, such as splashing and avalanches, can be conveniently generated by this meshless approach without sacriﬁcing physical accuracy. We generalize this discrete model to rigid bodies by distributing particles over their surfaces. In this way, two-way coupling between granular materials and rigid bodies is achieved.},

In particular the popular level set method is usually initialized by a distance field. The main focus of our work is on simplifying the computation of the sign when generating signed distance fields. Previous methods largely rely on scan conversion to classify voxels as being inside or outside. In contrast, our method relies on defining a pseudo normal, the angle weighted normal, which is used to determine, for each grid point, whether that point is inside or outside. This leads to a method for generating signed distance fields which is a simple and straight- forward extension of the method for generating unsigned distance fields. We prove that our choice of pseudo normal leads to a correct technique for computing the sign.},

A simple constraint locks a set of particles onto a surface while the particles and the surface move. We use the constraint to make surfaces follow particles, and to make particles follow surfaces. We implement control points for direct manipulation by specifying particle motions, then solving for surface motion that maintains the constraint. For sampling and rendering, we run the constraint in the other direction, creating ﬂoater particles that roam freely over the surface. Local repulsion is used to make ﬂoaters spread evenly across the surface. By varying the radius of repulsion adaptively, and ﬁssioning or killing particles based on the local density, we can achieve good sampling distributions very rapidly, and maintain them even in the face of rapid and extreme deformations and changes in surface topology.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to quickly initialize additional fluid in a rest state in simulations with any 3D boundary shape and able to preserve any already existing fluid. Our approach only uses the density property of the particles to allow compatibility with any smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulation scheme and any boundaries model. This initialization method is fast enough to allow the initialization of new fluid volumes interactively while the simulation is running. We showcase our approach by proposing a method to create a dynamic simulation window, allowing the restriction of simulating the fluid only around moving objects.

In this approach, which considers the particles of a meshless method immersed in an {FVM} grid, the {FVM} grid cells are classified into either pure or mixed {FVM} cells, the latter of which contain {SPH} particles. A finite-element-method shape function is applied to map the variables from the {SPH} particles to the {FVM} cells, and the nodal and cell velocities are then obtained. The interaction of the fluid with the structure is computed using moving reflection boundary conditions at cell interfaces with {SPH} particles. The interactions of the structure with the fluid are computed from the pressure differences around the {SPH} particles. The processes for computing the coupled {FVM}–{SPH} method are described in detail herein. The validity of the presented coupled {FVM}–{SPH} method was verified using a theoretical model of a piston, and the numerical results were found to agree well with the theoretical approximations, indicating the accuracy of the proposed coupled method. The results of the method were then compared with the results of an experiment involving a blast-driven steel plate. Good agreement between the experimental and numerical results was obtained, and the maximum difference was 3.44\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed coupled {FVM}–{SPH} method when applied to the interaction of a shock wave with a structure.},

	abstract = {Despite their cinematic appeal, turbulent flows involving fluid-solid coupling remain a computational challenge in animation. At the root of this current limitation is the numerical dispersion from which most accurate Navier-Stokes solvers suffer: proper coupling between fluid and solid often generates artificial dispersion in the form of local, parasitic trains of velocity oscillations, eventually leading to numerical instability. While successive improvements over the years have led to conservative and detail-preserving fluid integrators, the dispersive nature of these solvers is rarely discussed despite its dramatic impact on fluid-structure interaction. In this paper, we introduce a novel low-dissipation and low-dispersion fluid solver that can simulate two-way coupling in an efficient and scalable manner, even for turbulent flows. In sharp contrast with most current {CG} approaches, we construct our solver from a kinetic formulation of the flow derived from statistical mechanics. Unlike existing lattice Boltzmann solvers, our approach leverages
              high-order moment relaxations
              as a key to controlling both dissipation and dispersion of the resulting scheme. Moreover, we combine our new fluid solver with the immersed boundary method to easily handle fluid-solid coupling through time adaptive simulations. Our kinetic solver is highly parallelizable by nature, making it ideally suited for implementation on single- or multi-{GPU} computing platforms. Extensive comparisons with existing solvers on synthetic tests and real-life experiments are used to highlight the multiple advantages of our work over traditional and more recent approaches, in terms of accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.},

The goal of this article is to explain how to model an incompressible fluid, and how to write a computer program that simulates it. I will start from Newton laws "\$F = ma\$" applied to a bunch of particles, then show how Euler's equation can be deduced from them by "taking a step backward" and seeing the fluid as a continuum. Then I will show how to make a computer program. Incompressibility is one of the main difficulties to write a computer program that simulates a fluid. I will explain how recent advances in computational mathematics result in a computer object that can be used to represent a fluid and that naturally satisfies the incompressibility constraint. Equipped with this representation, the algorithm that simulates the fluid becomes extremely simple, and has been proved to converge to the solution of the equation (by Gallouet and Merigot).},

These parameters are found as the (unique) solution of a convex optimization problem -- semi-discrete Monge-Amp{\textbackslash}`ere equation -- stemming from optimal transport theory. In this article, this setting is extended to objects with free boundaries and arbitrary topology, evolving in a domain of arbitrary shape, by solving a partial optimal transport problem. The resulting Lagrangian scheme makes it possible to accurately control the volume of the object, while precisely tracking interfaces, interactions, collisions, and topology changes.},

Because the velocity-based formulation is more commonly used in graphics, our Monte Carlo solver can be readily extended with various techniques from the fluid simulation literature. We derive our method by solving the Navier-Stokes equations via operator splitting and designing a pointwise Monte Carlo estimator for each substep. We reformulate the projection and diffusion steps as integration problems based on the recently introduced walk-on-boundary technique [Sugimoto et al. 2023]. We transform the volume integral arising from the source term of the pressure Poisson equation into a form more amenable to practical numerical evaluation. Our resulting velocity-based formulation allows for the proper simulation of scenes that the prior vorticity-based Monte Carlo method [{RiouxLavoie} and Sugimoto et al. 2022] either simulates incorrectly or cannot support. We demonstrate that our method can easily incorporate advancements drawn from conventional non-Monte Carlo methods by showing how one can straightforwardly add buoyancy effects, divergence control capabilities, and numerical dissipation reduction methods, such as advection-reflection and {PIC}/{FLIP} methods.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a fast incompressible {SPH} ({ISPH}) solver implemented to run entirely on a graphics processing unit ({GPU}) capable of simulating several millions of particles in three dimensions on a single {GPU}. The {ISPH} algorithm is implemented by converting the highly optimised open-source weakly-compressible {SPH} ({WCSPH}) code {DualSPHysics} to run {ISPH} on the {GPU}, combining it with the open-source linear algebra library {ViennaCL} for fast solutions of the pressure Poisson equation ({PPE}). Several challenges are addressed with this research: constructing a {PPE} matrix every timestep on the {GPU} for moving particles, optimising the limited {GPU} memory, and exploiting fast matrix solvers. The {ISPH} pressure projection algorithm is implemented as 4 separate stages, each with a particle sweep, including an algorithm for the population of the {PPE} matrix suitable for the {GPU}, and mixed precision storage methods. An accurate and robust {ISPH} boundary condition ideal for parallel processing is also established by adapting an existing {WCSPH} boundary condition for {ISPH}. A variety of validation cases are presented: an impulsively started plate, incompressible flow around a moving square in a box, and dambreaks (2-D and 3-D) which demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and speed of the methodology. Fragmentation of the free surface is shown to influence the performance of matrix preconditioners and therefore the {PPE} matrix solution time. The Jacobi preconditioner demonstrates robustness and reliability in the presence of fragmented flows. For a dambreak simulation, {GPU} speed ups demonstrate up to 10–18 times and 1.1–4.5 times compared to single-threaded and 16-threaded {CPU} run times respectively.},

	abstract = {Thermal capillary migration is a phenomenon due to the Marangoni effect, which refers to the spontaneous motion of a liquid on a non-isothermal surface. Numerical simulation of thermal capillary migration of a droplet is extremely difficult due to the multi-physics field coupling and the violent motion of the droplet surface. In this paper, an improved smooth particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method is developed for simulating thermal capillary migration of a droplet driven by thermal gradient. In improved {SPH} model, an improved continuous surface force model is proposed to enhance the accuracy and stability of surface tension force calculation by introducing an improved surface tangential force. The contact angle model is utilized to model the surface wettability. The {SPH} method for simulating the thermal fluid flow is developed based on the continuum, momentum, and energy equations. In addition, kernel gradient correction and particle shifting technique are utilized to improve the accuracy and stability of the {SPH} method. The correctness and effectiveness of the improved {SPH} method are verified by numerical examples. Moreover, the motions of a droplet driven by thermal gradient under different conditions are investigated. Comparing with the results obtained by experiments and other resources, we can conclude that the improved {SPH} model is effective in modeling the thermal capillary migration of a droplet.},

	abstract = {Starting from the single graphics processing unit ({GPU}) version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) code {DualSPHysics}, a multi-{GPU} {SPH} program is developed for free-surface ﬂows. The approach is based on a spatial decomposition technique, whereby diﬀerent portions (sub-domains) of the physical system under study are assigned to diﬀerent {GPUs}. Communication between devices is achieved with the use of Message Passing Interface ({MPI}) application programming interface ({API}) routines. The use of the sorting algorithm radix sort for inter-{GPU} particle migration and sub-domain “halo” building (which enables interaction between {SPH} particles of diﬀerent subdomains) is described in detail. With the resulting scheme it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out simulations that could also be performed on a single {GPU}, but they can now be performed even faster than on one of these devices alone. On the other hand, accelerated simulations can be performed with up to 32 million particles on the current architecture, which is beyond the limitations of a single {GPU} due to memory constraints. A study of weak and strong scaling behaviour, speedups and eﬃciency of the resulting program is presented including an investigation to elucidate the computational bottlenecks. Last, possibilities for reduction of the eﬀects of overhead on computational eﬃciency in future versions of our scheme are discussed.},

	abstract = {Starting from the single graphics processing unit ({GPU}) version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) code {DualSPHysics}, a multi-{GPU} {SPH} program is developed for free-surface flows. The approach is based on a spatial decomposition technique, whereby different portions (sub-domains) of the physical system under study are assigned to different {GPUs}. Communication between devices is achieved with the use of Message Passing Interface ({MPI}) application programming interface ({API}) routines. The use of the sorting algorithm radix sort for inter-{GPU} particle migration and sub-domain “halo” building (which enables interaction between {SPH} particles of different sub-domains) is described in detail. With the resulting scheme it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out simulations that could also be performed on a single {GPU}, but they can now be performed even faster than on one of these devices alone. On the other hand, accelerated simulations can be performed with up to 32 million particles on the current architecture, which is beyond the limitations of a single {GPU} due to memory constraints. A study of weak and strong scaling behaviour, speedups and efficiency of the resulting program is presented including an investigation to elucidate the computational bottlenecks. Last, possibilities for reduction of the effects of overhead on computational efficiency in future versions of our scheme are discussed.},

In this paper, the Graphic Processing Units ({GPUs}) are explored to accelerate an {SPH}-{SWE} model for wider applications. Unlike Central Processing Units ({CPUs}), {GPUs} are highly parallelized, which makes it suitable for accelerating scientific computing algorithms like {SPH}. The aim is to design a {GPU}-based {SPH} model for solving the two-dimensional {SWEs} with variable smoothing lengths. Furthermore, a quad-tree neighbour searching method is implemented to further optimize the model performance.

	abstract = {Graphical Processing Units ({GPUs}) are massive ﬂoating-point stream processors, and through the recent development of tools such as {CUDA} and {OpenCL} it has become possible to fully utilize the bandwidth and computational power they contain. A computationally challenging problem is how to model movements of liquids. We have developed a {GPU}-based framework for 3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}). This paper describes the methods used for implementing fast simulations of ﬂuids dynamics using {GPUs}, and compares the performance of the implementation to previous {SPH} implementations. Our implementation uses the acceleration data structures found in the {NVIDIA} ”Particles” demo, but implements {SPH} instead of its simpler mass-spring system. The implementation uses {CUDA} and has been highly optimized to the point where a scaled simulation can run in ”real-time”. We implement two different {SPH} models, a simpliﬁed model for newtonian ﬂuids, and a complex model for non-newtonian ﬂuids. The complex {SPH} model is used to simulate ﬂowing snow avalanches. Using our simple {SPH} model and a {NVIDIA} {GeForce} 260 {GTX} we achieve 38 {FPS} with 256K particles, 63 {FPS} with 128K particles and 99 {FPS} with 64K particles. Open source code will be provided. This should make our work very useful not only for our current work on simulating snow avalanches, but also for other {CFD} applications that need faster simulations of many particles.},

We attempt to go beyond existing work in complexity and introduce a new model, method and benchmark. We propose {EAGLE}, a large-scale dataset of 1.1 million 2D meshes resulting from simulations of unsteady fluid dynamics caused by a moving flow source interacting with nonlinear scene structure, comprised of 600 different scenes of three different types. To perform future forecasting of pressure and velocity on the challenging {EAGLE} dataset, we introduce a new mesh transformer. It leverages node clustering, graph pooling and global attention to learn long-range dependencies between spatially distant data points without needing a large number of iterations, as existing {GNN} methods do. We show that our transformer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on, both, existing synthetic and real datasets and on {EAGLE}. Finally, we highlight that our approach learns to attend to airflow, integrating complex information in a single iteration.},

However, the interactivity is lost for larger scenes even if only the areas around the bodies have any visual interest. In this paper, we present a novel approach to quickly initialize additional fluid in a rest state in simulations with any 3D boundary shape and able to preserve any already existing fluid. Our approach only uses the density property of the particles to allow compatibility with any smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulation scheme and any boundaries model. This initialization method is fast enough to allow the initialization of new fluid volumes interactively while the simulation is running. We showcase our approach by proposing a method to create a dynamic simulation window, allowing the restriction of simulating the fluid only around moving objects.

These features can significantly undermine fundamental requirements for a successful training process, such as the Markovian properties of the transition model. To address this challenge, we propose a new benchmarking environment for aquatic navigation using recent advances in the integration between game engines and {DRL}. In more detail, we show that our benchmarking environment is problematic even for state-of-the-art {DRL} approaches that may struggle to generate reliable policies in terms of generalization power and safety. Specifically, we focus on {PPO}, one of the most widely accepted algorithms, and we propose advanced training techniques (such as curriculum learning and learnable hyperparameters).

Our method uses a low- and a high-resolution simulation that run at the same time. While in the coarse simulation the whole fluid is represented by large particles, the fine level simulates only a subset of the fluid with small particles. The subset can be arbitrarily defined and also dynamically change over time to capture complex flows and small-scale surface details. The low- and high-resolution simulations are coupled by including feedback forces and defining appropriate boundary conditions. Our method offers the benefit that particles are of the same size within each simulation level. This avoids particle splitting and merging processes, and allows the simulation of very large resolution differences without any stability problems. The model is easy to implement, and we show how it can be integrated into a standard {SPH} simulation as well as into the incompressible {PCISPH} solver. Compared to the single-resolution simulation, our method produces similar surface details while improving the efficiency linearly to the achieved reduction rate of the particle number.},

	abstract = {We propose a new ghost fluid approach for free surface and solid boundary conditions in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}) liquid simulations. Prior methods either suffer from a spurious numerical surface tension artifact or drift away from the mass conservation constraint, and do not capture realistic cohesion of liquid to solids. Our Ghost {SPH} scheme resolves this with a new particle sampling algorithm to create a narrow layer of ghost particles in the surrounding air and solid, with careful extrapolation and treatment of fluid variables to reflect the boundary conditions. We also provide a new, simpler form of artificial viscosity based on {XSPH}. Examples demonstrate how the new approach captures real liquid behaviour previously unattainable by {SPH} with very little extra cost.},

To enhance the performance of computing systems, researchers and developers use the parallel computing architecture of {GPU}. On the other hand, to reduce the development time of new products, two programming models are included in {GPU}, which are {OpenCL} (Open Computing Language) and {CUDA} (Compute Unified Device Architecture). The benefit of involving the two programming models in {GPU} is that researchers and developers don't have to understand {OpenGL}, {DirectX} or other program design, but can use {GPU} through simple programming language. {OpenCL} is an open standard {API}, which has the advantage of cross-platform. {CUDA} is a parallel computer architecture developed by {NVIDIA}, which includes Runtime {API} and Driver {API}. Compared with {OpenCL}, {CUDA} is with better performance. In this paper, we used plenty of similar kernels to compare the computing performance of C, {OpenCL} and {CUDA}, the two kinds of {API}'s on {NVIDIA} Quadro 4000 {GPU}. The experimental result showed that, the executive time of {CUDA} Driver {API} was 94.9\% 99.0\% faster than that of C, while and the executive time of {CUDA} Driver {API} was 3.8\% 5.4\% faster than that of {OpenCL}.

We also show that this difference is due to unfair comparisons: in fact, {OpenCL} can achieve similar performance to {CUDA} under a fair comparison. Therefore, we define a fair comparison of the two types of applications, providing guidelines for more potential analyses. We also investigate {OpenCL}'s portability by running the benchmarks on other prevailing platforms with minor modifications. Overall, we conclude that {OpenCL}'s portability does not fundamentally affect its performance, and {OpenCL} can be a good alternative to {CUDA}.},

The traditional modeling method with Cartesian coordinates faces difficulties in accurately representing boundary shapes and would lose flow details near the slender structure. The modeling method with the signed distance field ({SDF}) and particle shifting technique can obtain a uniform boundary-fitting particle distribution. However, the accuracy and efficiency of {SDF} construction, as well as the conservation of geometry volume after discretizing the model into particles, need to be further improved. In this paper, a general particle modeling method is proposed for arbitrary geometries. A double search technique is proposed to quickly construct the narrowband signed distance field ({NSDF}) near the geometry boundary. A scanning method is developed for the {NSDF} to determine the inner/outer relationship between the non-narrowband grids and the geometry. In addition, a volume compensation technique is proposed to ensure the volume conservation of the particle model. A modeling evaluation system is established, and three evaluation indicators are proposed to evaluate the quality of particle distribution and total volume conservation for particle models. Complex geometries such as the Stanford bunny, the Stanford dragon, and the centrifugal impeller are modeled to validate the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can achieve a more uniform and accurate boundary-fitting particle distribution for complex geometries, and it can also effectively model tiny structures while significantly reducing total geometry volume error.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel method to predict pressure values at boundary particles in incompressible divergence-free {SPH} simulations ({DFSPH}). Our approach employs Moving Least Squares ({MLS}) to predict the pressure at boundary particles. Therefore, {MLS} computes hyperplanes that approximate the pressure ﬁeld at the interface between ﬂuid and boundary particles. We compare this approach with two previous techniques. One previous technique mirrors the pressure from ﬂuid to boundary particles. The other one extrapolates the pressure from ﬂuid to boundary particles, but uses a gradient that is computed with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}). We motivate that gradient-based extrapolation is more accurate than mirroring. We further motivate that our proposed {MLS} gradient is less error prone than the {SPH} gradient at the boundary. In our experiments, we indicate artifacts in previous approaches. We show that these artifacts are signiﬁcantly reduced with our approach resulting in simulation steps that can be twice as large compared to previous methods. We further present challenging and complex scenarios to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed boundary handling.},

However, perhaps due to its relative youth, the video game sector has not yet developed the same level of environmental awareness as other computing technologies despite the estimated three billion regular video game players in the world. This work evaluates the energy consumption of the most widely used industry-scale video game engines: Unity and Unreal Engine. Specifically, our work uses three scenarios representing relevant aspects of video games (Physics, Static Meshes, and Dynamic Meshes) to compare the energy consumption of the engines. The aim is to determine the influence of using each of the two engines on energy consumption. Our research has confirmed significant differences in the energy consumption of video game engines: 351\% in Physics in favor of Unity, 17\% in Static Meshes in favor of Unity, and 26\% in Dynamic Meshes in favor of Unreal Engine. These results represent an opportunity for worldwide potential savings of at least 51 {TWh} per year, which is equivalent to the annual consumption of nearly 13 million European households. This might encourage a new branch of research on energy-efficient video game engines.},

	abstract = {Computing on graphics processing units ({GPUs}) has become standard in scientific computing, allowing for incredible performance gains over classical {CPUs} for many computational methods. As {GPUs} were originally designed for 3D rendering, they still have several features for that purpose that are not used in scientific computing. Among them, ray tracing is a powerful technology used to render 3D scenes. In this paper, we propose exploiting ray tracing technology to compute particle interactions with a cutoff distance in a 3D environment. We describe algorithmic tricks and geometric patterns to find the interaction lists for each particle. This approach allows us to compute interactions with quasi-linear complexity in the number of particles without building a grid of cells or an explicit kd-tree. We compare the performance of our approach with a classical approach based on a grid of cells and show that, currently, ours is slower in most cases but could pave the way for future methods.},

	abstract = {A two-way hybrid model based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) method is proposed in this paper to simulate wave propagation and deformation effectively. The hybrid model is composed of two submodels: the first submodel is based on the Boussinesq equations (B-{SPH}) for simulating wave propagation, and the second submodel is based on the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations ({NS}-{SPH}) for simulating wave deformation caused by interactions with structures. The exchange of information between the two submodels is realized through an open-boundary method: the results derived from the B-{SPH} submodel are transferred to the open boundaries of the {NS}-{SPH} submodel through a relaxation function; the information derived from the {NS}-{SPH} submodel is matched to the open boundaries of the B-{SPH} submodel through the continuity equation. To obtain a stable pressure field in the {NS}-{SPH} submodel, the particle shifting technique ({PST}) is implemented. The subsequent validation of the hybrid model includes four typical numerical examples related to solitary and regular waves. The agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data indicates that the proposed hybrid model is suitable for simulating the propagation and deformation of shallow water waves. Compared with the traditional {NS}-{SPH} model, which uses N-S equations to describe the whole fluid domain, the hybrid model has greater computational efficiency.},

In particular, wall boundary conditions have been pivotal in {SPH} model development since it evolved from astrophysics to more generic fluid dynamics simulations. Despite considerable attention from researchers and numerous publications dedicated to formulating and assessing wall boundary conditions, few of them have addressed the crucial aspect of energy conservation. This work introduces a novel boundary condition designed with energy conservation as a primary consideration, effectively extending the unconditional stability of {SPH} to problems involving wall boundary conditions. The result is formulated within the framework of the Boundary Integrals technique. The proposal is tested on a number of cases: normal impact against a wall, adiabatic oscillations of a piston, dam break, and the water landing of a spacecraft.},

	title = {Divergence cleaning for weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics},
	abstract = {This paper presents a divergence cleaning formulation for the velocity in the weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) scheme. The proposed hyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning, ensures that the velocity divergence, div(u), is minimised throughout the simulation. The divergence equation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation through a scalar field ψ. A parabolic term is added to the time-evolving divergence equation, resulting in a hyperbolic/parabolic form, dissipating acoustic waves with a speed of sound proportional to the local Mach number in order to maximise dissipation of the velocity divergence, preventing unwanted diffusion of the pressure field. The div(u)-{SPH} algorithm is implemented in the open-source weakly compressible {SPH} solver {DualSPHysics}. The new formulation is validated against a range of challenging 2-D test cases including the Taylor-Green vortices, patch impact test, jet impinging on a surface, and wave impact in a sloshing tank. The results show that the new formulation reduces the divergence in the velocity field by at least one order of magnitude which prevents spurious numerical noise and the formation of unphysical voids. The temporal evolution of the impact pressures shows that the div(u){SPH} formulation virtually eliminates unwanted acoustic pressure oscillations. Investigation of particle resolution confirms that the new div(u)-{SPH} formulation does not reduce the spatial convergence rate.},

	abstract = {As part of the energy transition, the {UN} shipping organization has decided that by 2050 the oceans should be sailed in a climate-neutral way. As most ships are still based on fossil fuels, alternative propulsion systems such as hydrogen or electrically powered units must now be investigated. In the development of new ships, autonomous steering systems are also increasingly being researched. Therefore, the development of an autonomous fueling process for ships, based on sustainable e-fuels, is crucial for implementing sector coupling and thus decarbonizing the transportation industry. To execute the autonomous fueling process in a test environment, robots can be used to emulate the movement of the ship and accomplish the autonomous plugging and fueling process. When simulating ship movements multiple approaches are known, ranging from simple algebraic equations up to complex numerical simulations based on differential equations. We present an approach for a real-time-capable simulation of ship movements that can be performed by a collaborative robot kinematics. The wave simulation is based on the oceanographic spectra and the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform. With this approach, simulation times of less than ten milliseconds are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The ship wave is of great interest for wave drag and coastal erosion. This paper proposes a mechanism of ship wave transformation to explore the effects of ship speed and ship size on the waveform. Firstly, based on the theory of potential flow, the boundary integral equations for the Kelvin ship waves are obtained by deploying the different Kelvin sources or Rankine sources. Then, these integral equations are numerically discretized to a set of nonlinear equations. Finally, the Jacobian−free Newton–Krylov method with a preconditioner is adopted to solve the nonlinear equations. Though imitating plenty of different Kelvin wave patterns, the mechanism of ship wave transformation is proposed to conveniently generate the polymorphic Kelvin wake patterns. The above numerical simulation scheme is verified by comparing simulation results with real ship waves. After that, the wake angle is discussed with the effects of Froude number, source strength and source type by following the mechanism of ship wave transformation. The results show that the wake angle tends to decrease with ship speed but increase with ship size. In addition, for high ship speeds, the effect on the wake angle can be more dramatic.},

	abstract = {A concurrent binary tree ({CBT}) is a {GPU}-friendly data-structure suitable for the generation of bisection based terrain tessellations, i.e., adaptive triangulations over square domains. In this paper, we expand the benefits of this data-structure in two respects. First, we show how to bring bisection based tessellations to arbitrary polygon meshes rather than just squares. Our approach consists of mapping a triangular subdivision primitive, which we refer to as a bisector, to each halfedge of the input mesh. These bisectors can then be subdivided adaptively to produce conforming triangulations solely based on halfedge operators. Second, we alleviate a limitation that restricted the triangulations to low subdivision levels. We do so by using the {CBT} as a memory pool manager rather than an implicit encoding of the triangulation as done originally. By using a {CBT} in this way, we concurrently allocate and/or release bisectors during adaptive subdivision using shared {GPU} memory. We demonstrate the benefits of our improvements by rendering planetary scale geometry out of very coarse meshes. Performance-wise, our triangulation method evaluates in less than 0.2ms on console-level hardware.},

A major obstacle to performance portability is the diverse and conflicting set of constraints on memory access patterns across devices. Contemporary portable programming models address manycore parallelism (e.g., {OpenMP}, {OpenACC}, {OpenCL}) but fail to address memory access patterns. The Kokkos C++ library enables applications and domain libraries to achieve performance portability on diverse manycore architectures by unifying abstractions for both fine-grain data parallelism and memory access patterns. In this paper we describe Kokkos’ abstractions, summarize its application programmer interface ({API}), present performance results for unit-test kernels and mini-applications, and outline an incremental strategy for migrating legacy C++ codes to Kokkos.

Many modern software developers choose to adapt third-party extension platform to further improve customizability. As the project evolves, the requirements may change to include third-party extension support. However to design and to implement such platform is no trivial task, and should happen at the beginning of the project. In this paper, we have shown the four types of extensions that are often made to object-oriented software, namely Member Access Extension, Subclass Extension, Event-based Extension and Data Extension. And proposed a language-independent platform design that can be applied to an existing software project to support such third-party extensions. The platform exercises design patterns to implement its features. We also developed an Eclipse plugin that helps developers introduce the platform to existing Java software via semi-automatic code manipulation. We further conducted a comparative experiment to test our tool with volunteers from Waseda University and noticed a significant decrease of required effort.},

With both the producer and the customer unwilling to replace the existing application with a completely new one, adoption of design constructs and techniques which facilitate the application extension is a major design issue. In the current work we investigate the behavior of an object-oriented software application at a specific extension scenario, following three implementation alternatives with regards to a certain design problem relevant to the extension. The first alternative follows a simplistic solution, the second makes use of a design pattern and the third applies Aspect-Oriented Programming techniques to implement the same pattern. An assessment of the three alternatives is attempted, both on a qualitative and a quantitative level, by identifying the additional design implications needed to perform the extension and evaluating the effect of the extension on several quality attributes of the application.},

Achieving lifelike droplet splash simulations while managing computational resources has often resulted in sacrifices compromising the realism of visualizations. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past two decades, driven by advancements in particle-based methods such as Position-Based Dynamics ({PBD}) and Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics ({SPH}). These methods have enabled the simulation of droplet splash behaviour with increasing accuracy and reduced computational complexity. Integrating features like surface tensions, fluid incompressibility, and liquid-wall interactions has further enhanced the realism of the simulations. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and methodologies employed in droplet simulations and how they have evolved over time. Accurate droplet interaction visualization holds immense potential across diverse applications, including gaming, animation, medical simulations, and engineering scenarios like 3D printing simulations.},

Distributed control and central control represent two complementary paradigms to establish this capability. The selection of one of them leads to significant trade-offs regarding certain software qualities when designing a {SaS}. A promising approach to minimize these trade-offs is an integration, which combines the individual benefits to achieve the best of both paradigms. However, establishing such a multi-paradigm control requires comprehensive knowledge about control options and their interactions, which is hardly available.In this paper, we present patterns for integrating distributed and central control. We introduce them by a schema of Control Action Types ({CATs}). Each {CAT} describes a unique type of interaction between a central controller and a distributed controlled {SaS} to achieve a desired adaptation. Further, we identify involved tradeoffs between these {CATs} aiming at a systematic discussion of the range of multi-paradigm control for a {SaS}.},

	abstract = {In modern applications, performing a large number of activities and exchange of information, the architectural approach of microservices is increasingly required. If we make a more detailed analysis of them, they are nothing more than standalone applications that are synchronized in their communication between them, they are interchangeable in certain situations, and they are also divided by functionality. In addition to microservices, the so-called monolithic applications also work with the reception and processing of requests, which architecturally translates into an even greater concentration of functionality in one place and this leads to difficulties in their maintenance. In modern microservice architectures, different methods of communication are often used: microservices often communicate via {HTTP} with {RESTful} {API} design. {URLs} are used to detect and access microservices. Message Brokers: the use of communications brokers such as {RabbitMQ} 1 or Apache Kafka 2 provides an effective way of asynchronous communication. Whether we are talking about monolithic or microservice applications, it always comes the moment with the growing code, complex service structure and maintenance. In the current development, we focus on the implementation of a new service in a microservice architecture. The goal of the development is to create an application architecture using design patterns and optimization solutions that lead to fast and efficient operations of the business layer, which remains stable in its performance even with a large amount of data to process.1www.rabbitmq.com2https://kafka.apache.org},

These approaches are applied to thoroughly study the organization and dynamics of biological molecules, their complexes, and conformational changes in proteins and nucleic acids. Many mysteries, on the femtoseconds scale, have been revealed through the study of these conformational changes. These methods are applied in chemical physics, materials science, and biophysics. {MD} simulations are often used in computational biology to generate a comprehensive understanding of interactions between proteins and their ligands and address how much these interactions are flexible and shape conformational changes in molecules when a particular mutation is introduced.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to quickly initialize additional fluid in a rest state in simulations with any 3D boundary shape and able to preserve any already existing fluid. Our approach only uses the density property of the particles to allow compatibility with any smoothed-particle hydrodynamics ({SPH}) simulation scheme and any boundaries model. This initialization method is fast enough to allow the initialization of new fluid volumes interactively while the simulation is running. We showcase our approach by proposing a method to create a dynamic simulation window, allowing the restriction of simulating the fluid only around moving objects. We propose multiple experiments to demonstrate the capabilities and performance of our approach.},

In the context of incompressible/weakly-compressible ﬂuid ﬂow, the {SPH} method is more accurate when the particle distribution is uniform. Hence, for the time accurate simulation of ﬂow in the presence of complex boundaries, one must have both an accurate boundary discretization as well as a uniform distribution of particles to initialize the simulation. This process of obtaining an initial uniform distribution of particles is called “particle packing”. In this paper, various particle packing algorithms present in the literature are implemented and compared. An improved {SPH}-based algorithm is proposed which produces uniform particle distributions of both the ﬂuid and solid domains in two and three dimensions. Some challenging geometries are constructed to demonstrate the accuracy of the new algorithm. The implementation of the algorithm is open source and the manuscript is fully reproducible.},

This process generates a spatially periodic ocean displacement that can be tiled to pave a large ocean surface. However, this creates tiling artifacts for large oceans. This effect can be toned down by mixing the displacement with noise, which disturbs the appearance of the ocean, or by overlapping the result of several {IFFT} at different scales, which increases computation times, all while not fully removing the periodic aspect. We propose to instead use tiling and blending, a procedural generation algorithm popular for real-time texture synthesis, in order to generate variations of the mesh displacement. This method also enables us to author the direction of the waves using a flow map. We show that this method is especially fast and can create a fully aperiodic ocean with minimal downsides.},

	abstract = {Neighbor searching is an essential and computationally heavy step in particle-based numerical methods such as discrete element method ({DEM}), molecular dynamics, peridynamics, and smooth particle hydrodynamics. This article presents a novel approach to accelerate particle-based simulations by leveraging ray tracing ({RT}) cores in addition to {CUDA} cores on {RTX} {GPUs}. The neighbor search problem is first numerically converted into a general ray tracing problem so that it can be possible to utilize the hardware acceleration of {RT} cores. A new, general-purpose {RT}-based neighbor search algorithm is then proposed and benchmarked with a prevailing cell-based one. As a showcase, both algorithms are implemented into a {GPU}-based {DEM} code for simulating large-scale granular problems including packing, column collapse and debris flow. The overall simulation performance is examined with varying problem sizes and {GPU} specs. It demonstrates that the {RT}-based simulations are 10\%–60\% faster than the cell-based ones, depending on the simulated problems and {GPU} specs. This study offers a new recipe for next-generation high-performance computing of large-scale engineering problems using particle-based numerical methods.},

	abstract = {Fluid droplets behave significantly different from larger fluid bodies. At smaller scales, surface tension and friction between fluids and the boundary play an essential role and are even able to counteract gravitational forces. There are quite a few existing approaches that model surface tension forces within an {SPH} environment. However, as often as not, physical correctness and simulation stability are still major concerns with many surface tension formulations. We propose a new approach to compute surface tension that is both robust and produces the right amount of surface tension.
            Conversely, less attention was given to friction forces at the fluid-boundary interface. Recent experimental research indicates that Coulomb friction can be used to describe the behavior of droplets resting on a slope. Motivated by this, we develop a novel friction force formulation at the fluid-boundary interface following the Coulomb model, which allows us to replicate a new range of well known fluid behavior such as the motion of rain droplets on a window pane.
            Both forces are combined with an {IISPH} variant into one unified solver that is able to simultaneously compute strongly coupled surface tension, friction and pressure forces.},

Such scenarios have hitherto been restricted to the domain of off-line computation. To reduce computation time we use a hybrid grid representation composed of regular cubic cells on top of a layer of tall cells. With this layout water above an arbitrary terrain can be represented without consuming an excessive amount of memory and compute power, while focusing effort on the area near the surface where it most matters. Additionally, we optimized the grid representation for a {GPU} implementation of the ﬂuid solver. To further accelerate the simulation, we introduce a specialized multigrid algorithm for solving the Poisson equation and propose solver modiﬁcations to keep the simulation stable for large time steps. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of our approach in several real-world scenarios, all running above 30 frames per second on a modern {GPU}. Some scenes include additional features such as two-way rigid body coupling as well as particle representations of sub-grid detail.},

In order to avoid the limitations typically associated with a height ﬁeld approach, we simulate the entire top surface of the water volume with a state of the art, fully three-dimensional Navier-Stokes free surface solver. Our philosophy is to use the best available method near the interface (in the three-dimensional region) and to coarsen the mesh away from the interface for efﬁciency. We coarsen with tall, thin cells (as opposed to octrees or {AMR}), because they maintain good resolution horizontally allowing for accurate representation of bottom topography.},

              Introduction
              Unity is a powerful and versatile tool for creating real‐time experiments. It includes a built‐in compute shader language, a C‐like programming language designed for massively parallel General‐Purpose {GPU} ({GPGPU}) computing. However, as Unity is primarily developed for multi‐platform game creation, its compute shader language has several limitations, including the lack of multi‐{GPU} computation support and incomplete mathematical libraries.
            
            
              Contribution
              To address these limitations, {GPU} manufacturers have developed specialized programming models, such as {CUDA} and {HIP}, which enable developers to leverage the full computational power of modern {GPUs}. This article introduces an open‐source tool designed to bridge the gap between Unity and {CUDA}, allowing developers to integrate {CUDA}'s capabilities within Unity‐based projects.
            
            
              Methods
              The proposed solution establishes an interoperability framework that facilitates communication between Unity and {CUDA}. The tool is designed to efficiently transfer data, execute {CUDA} kernels, and retrieve results, ensuring seamless integration into Unity's rendering and computation pipeline.
            
            
              Results
              Our tool extends Unity's capabilities by enabling {CUDA}‐based computations, overcoming the inherent limitations of Unity's compute shader language. This integration allows developers to exploit multi‐{GPU} architectures, leverage advanced mathematical functions, and enhance computational performance for real‐time applications.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for the real-time simulation of fluid surface waves and their interactions with floating objects. The method is based on the new concept of wave particles, which offers a simple, fast, and unconditionally stable approach to wave simulation. We show how graphics hardware can be used to convert wave particles to a height field surface, which is warped horizontally to account for local wave-induced flow. The method is appropriate for most fluid simulation situations that do not involve significant global flow. It is demonstrated to work well in constrained areas, including wave reflections off of boundaries, and in unconstrained areas, such as an ocean surface. Interactions with floating objects are easily integrated by including wave forces on the objects and wave generation due to object motion. Theoretical foundations and implementation details are provided, and experiments demonstrate that we achieve plausible realism. Timing studies show that the method is scalable to allow simulation of wave interaction with several hundreds of objects at real-time rates.},
